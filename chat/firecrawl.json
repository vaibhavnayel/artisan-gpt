Here are the 8 main reasons why Artisan is better than 11x.\n\n1\n\nYou Are as Obsessed With UX as We Are\n-------------------------------------\n\nWe are obsessed with user experience. When it comes to functionality, we understand how to create software that’s intuitive and easy to use. The Artisan platform is intuitive, streamlined, and meticulously crafted based on feedback from 100s of users. Users who've experienced both our platform and 11x consistently report that ours is clearer, more stable, visually appealing, and easier to master. 11x users report emails written in wrong languages, tracking breaks, hallucinations, slowness and other glitches.\n\n[Talk to Sales](/talk-to-sales?page_source=/artisan-vs-11x)\n\n2\n\nYou Love to Have as Much Data on Leads as Possible\n--------------------------------------------------\n\nWe’re automating the most sophisticated outbound strategies for reaching prospects with buying intent. Our platform integrates built-in search intent data, funding and company data from CrunchBase, scraped data from leads’ websites, Twitter and LinkedIn profiles and many more enrichment sources - all included in the cost of your subscription.\n\n[Talk to Sales](/talk-to-sales?page_source=/artisan-vs-11x)\n\n3\n\nYou Like Being Onboarded Fast\n-----------------------------\n\nWith 11x’s platform, we’ve been told onboarding takes 2-3 weeks and involves a lot of manual processes. On Artisan, not only can Ava independently onboard you via chat, you can also directly connect your mailboxes to our platform and start sending out emails instantly while they warm themselves up.\n\n[Talk to Sales](/talk-to-sales?page_source=/artisan-vs-11x)\n\n4\n\nYou Love New & Amazing Features\n-------------------------------\n\nWe ship product crazy fast and listen to what our users want, while we’ve heard that 11x’s product has stagnated. We’ve got some extremely exciting things coming in our roadmap, and we are relentlessly working to build the best sales software ecosystem and AI employees on the market.\n\n[Talk to Sales](/talk-to-sales?page_source=/artisan-vs-11x)\n\n5\n\nYou Like Getting Email Responses\n--------------------------------\n\nRather than running GPT to write bland, generic emails, we have advanced AI Sales Playbooks that replicate top-performing outbound strategies that a human would typically do manually. We’ve done our research into what personalized cold emails get the highest response rates and we bring them to your doorstep. That's why one user who tried both platforms reported a ~4x higher response rate on Artisan than 11x, whose emails had a high rate of SPAM complaints.\n\n[Talk to Sales](/talk-to-sales?page_source=/artisan-vs-11x)\n\n6\n\nYou Like Working With Companies Backed By Y Combinator & the Best Investors\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWe’ve raised over $11M in seed funding from top-tier investors including Y Combinator, Soma Capital, Sequoia Scout, BOND Capital, and many more. We also have community investments from sales executives who bring years of industry experience and believe in our product.\n\n[Talk to Sales](/talk-to-sales?page_source=/artisan-vs-11x)\n\n7\n\nYou Love Amazing Customer Success\n---------------------------------\n\nWe’re committed to making sure you have the best possible experience using the Artisan platform. Your dedicated customer success manager will work closely with you to ensure your ongoing success. We can optionally set up a direct Slack connection so you have multiple points of contact at Artisan available 24/7.\n\n[Talk to Sales](/talk-to-sales?page_source=/artisan-vs-11x)\n\n8\n\nYou Want to Work With a US Company\n----------------------------------\n\nWe are headquartered in San Francisco, with team members across the US and time zones across the globe. 11x is a UK company, with their team highly concentrated in London.\n\n[Talk to Sales](/talk-to-sales?page_source=/artisan-vs-11x)\n\n![feature-image](https://www.artisan.co/_next/image?url=%2Fassets%2Fcomparison%2F11x%2Freason1.webp&w=3840&q=75)\n\n![feature-image](https://www.artisan.co/_next/image?url=%2Fassets%2Fcomparison%2F11x%2Freason2.webp&w=3840&q=75)\n\n![feature-image](https://www.artisan.co/_next/image?url=%2Fassets%2Fcomparison%2F11x%2Freason3.webp&w=3840&q=75)\n\n![feature-image](https://www.artisan.co/_next/image?url=%2Fassets%2Fcomparison%2F11x%2Freason4.webp&w=3840&q=75)\n\n![feature-image](https://www.artisan.co/_next/image?url=%2Fassets%2Fcomparison%2F11x%2Freason5.webp&w=3840&q=75)\n\n![feature-image](https://www.artisan.co/_next/image?url=%2Fassets%2Fcomparison%2F11x%2Freason6.webp&w=3840&q=75)\n\n![feature-image](https://www.artisan.co/_next/image?url=%2Fassets%2Fcomparison%2F11x%2Freason7.webp&w=3840&q=75)\n\n![feature-image](https://www.artisan.co/_next/image?url=%2Fassets%2Fcomparison%2F11x%2Freason8.webp&w=3840&q=75)\n\nComparison\n\nSide-by-Side UI Comparison\n--------------------------\n\nCampaignsEmail ReviewInboxAnalytics\n\n![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/comparison/11x/campaigns-11x.webp)\n\n![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/comparison/11x/campaigns-artisan.webp)\n\n![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/ava-sales-agent/img-bg-effect.svg)\n\nFeatures\n\nUnique Artisan Features That 11x Lacks\n--------------------------------------\n\nMailboxesLeads CRMLead ProfileChat With AvaDark Mode\n\n![Mailboxes](https://www.artisan.co/_next/image?url=%2Fassets%2Fcomparison%2F11x%2Ffeature1.webp&w=3840&q=75)![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/ava-sales-agent/img-bg-effect.svg)\n\nMailboxes\n\nUnlike 11x, Artisan enables you to seamlessly manage and monitor multiple mailboxes from a single interface, ensuring mailbox health and email deliverability.\n\n[Talk To Sales](/talk-to-sales?page_source=/artisan-vs-11x)\n\n![workflow-graphic](https://www.artisan.co/_next/image?url=%2Fassets%2Fcomparison%2F11x%2Fava-graphic.webp&w=3840&q=75)\n\nReady To Onboard the Best AI SDR on the Market?\n-----------------------------------------------\n\nTalk To Sales\n\nReady to Supercharge Your Outbound?\n-----------------------------------\n\nOur AI-first platform equips your team with best-in-class outbound tools and our AI BDR Ava, who automates your entire outbound workflow.\n\nPhone\n\nGet Started\n\n### Products\n\n*   [Artisan Sales Overview](/sales-ai)\n    \n*   [Ava, the AI Sales Agent](/ai-sales-agent)\n    \n*   [B2B Data](/products/b2b-data)\n    \n*   [Sales Playbooks](/products/sales-playbooks)\n    \n*   [Email Warmup](/products/email-warmup)\n    \n*   [Sales Automation](/products/sales-automation)\n    \n\n### Resources\n\n*   [Blog](/blog)\n    \n*   [Demos](/watch-demo)\n    \n*   [Support](https://support.artisan.co/)\n    \n*   [Case Studies](/casestudies)\n    \n*   ChangelogSoon\n    \n\n### Solutions\n\n*   [Enterprise](/solutions/enterprise)\n    \n*   [Midmarket](/solutions/midmarket)\n    \n*   [Startups](/solutions/startups)\n    \n*   Lead Gen AgenciesSoon\n    \n\n### Company\n\n*   [About Us](/about)\n    \n*   [Contact Us](/contact-us)\n    \n*   [Careers](/careers)\n    \n*   Artisan LabsSoon\n    \n\n![artisan-logo](https://www.artisan.co/_next/image?url=%2Fassets%2Flogo.webp&w=384&q=75)\n\n© 2024 Artisan AI Inc.

Customer Responsibilities\n-----------------------------\n\n  \na. Compliance with Laws.

You will inform us without undue delay if you are not able to comply with your responsibilities under this ‘Compliance with Laws’ section or applicable Data Protection Laws.  \n  \nb. Controller Instructions. The parties agree that the Agreement (including this DPA), together with your use of the Subscription Service in accordance with the Agreement, constitute your complete Instructions to us in relation to the Processing of Personal Data, so long as you may provide additional instructions during the subscription term that are consistent with the Agreement, the nature and lawful use of the Subscription Service.  \n  \nc. Security. You are responsible for independently determining whether the data security provided for in the Subscription Service adequately meets your obligations under applicable Data Protection Laws. You are also responsible for your secure use of the Subscription Service, including protecting the security of Personal Data in transit to and from the Subscription Service (including to securely backup or encrypt any such Personal Data).\n\n  \n\n3\\. Artisan AI Obligations\n--------------------------\n\n  \na. Compliance with Instructions. We will only Process Personal Data for the purposes described in this DPA or as otherwise agreed within the scope of your lawful Instructions, except where and to the extent otherwise required by applicable law. We are not responsible for compliance with any Data Protection Laws applicable to you or your industry that are not generally applicable to us.  \n  \nb. Conflict of Laws. If we become aware that we cannot Process Personal Data in accordance with your Instructions due to a legal requirement under any applicable law, we will (i) promptly notify you of that legal requirement to the extent permitted by the applicable law; and (ii) where necessary, cease all Processing (other than merely storing and maintaining the security of the affected Personal Data) until such time as you issue new Instructions with which we are able to comply. If this provision is invoked, we will not be liable to you under the Agreement for any failure to perform the applicable Subscription Services until such time as you issue new lawful Instructions with regard to the Processing.  \n  \nc. Security. We will implement and maintain appropriate technical and organizational measures to protect Personal Data from Personal Data Breaches, as described under Annex 2 to this DPA (“Security Measures”). Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary, we may modify or update the Security Measures at our discretion provided that such modification or update does not result in a material degradation in the protection offered by the Security Measures.  \n  \nd. Confidentiality. We will ensure that any personnel whom we authorize to Process Personal Data on our behalf is subject to appropriate confidentiality obligations (whether a contractual or statutory duty) with respect to that Personal Data.  \n  \ne. Personal Data Breaches. We will notify you without undue delay after we become aware of any Personal Data Breach and will provide timely information relating to the Personal Data Breach as it becomes known or reasonably requested by you. At your request, we will promptly provide you with such reasonable assistance as necessary to enable you to notify relevant Personal Data Breaches to competent authorities and/or affected Data Subjects, if you are required to do so under Data Protection Laws.  \n  \nf. Deletion or Return of Personal Data. We will delete or return all Customer Data, including Personal Data (including copies thereof) Processed pursuant to this DPA, on termination or expiration of your Subscription Service. This term will apply except where we are required by applicable law to retain some or all of the Customer Data, or where we have archived Customer Data on back-up systems, which data we will securely isolate and protect from any further Processing and delete in accordance with our deletion practices. You may request the deletion of your Artisan AI account after expiration or termination of your subscription by emailing [hello@artisan.co](mailto:hello@artisan.co)\n.  \n  \nIf you need help retrieving your Customer Data during the Subscription Term, we will provide reasonable assistance to you, at your cost, and in accordance with the ‘Confidentiality’ section of the General Terms.\n\n  \n\n4\\. Data Subject Requests\n-------------------------\n\n  \nThe Subscription Service provides you with a number of controls that you can use to retrieve, correct, delete or restrict Personal Data, which you can use to assist it in connection with its obligations under Data Protection Laws, including your obligations relating to responding to requests from Data Subjects to exercise their rights under applicable Data Protection Laws (“Data Subject Requests”).  \n  \nTo the extent that you are unable to independently address a Data Subject Request through the Subscription Service, then upon your written request we will provide reasonable assistance to you to respond to any Data Subject Requests or requests from data protection authorities relating to the Processing of Personal Data under the Agreement. You will reimburse us for the commercially reasonable costs arising from this assistance.  \n  \nIf a Data Subject Request or other communication regarding the Processing of Personal Data under the Agreement is made directly to us, we will promptly inform you and will advise the Data Subject to submit their request to you. You will be solely responsible for responding substantively to any such Data Subject Requests or communications involving Personal Data.\n\n  \n\n5\\. Sub-Processors\n------------------\n\n  \nYou agree we may engage Sub-Processors to Process Personal Data on your behalf, and we do so in three ways. First, we may engage Sub-Processors to assist us with hosting and infrastructure. Second, we may engage with Sub-Processors to support product features and integrations. Third, we may engage with Artisan AI Affiliates as Sub-Processors for service and support. Some Sub-Processors will apply to you as default, and some Sub-Processors will apply only if you opt-in.  \n  \nWe have currently appointed, as Sub-Processors, the third parties and Artisan AI Affiliates listed in Annex 3 to this DPA. You may subscribe to receive notifications by email if we add or replace any Sub-Processors by emailing [hello@artisan.co](mailto:hello@artisan.co)\n. If you opt-in to receive such email, we will notify you at least 30 days prior to any such change.  \n  \nWe will give you the opportunity to object to the engagement of new Sub-Processors on reasonable grounds relating to the protection of Personal Data within 30 days of notifying you. If you do notify us of such an objection, the parties will discuss your concerns in good faith with a view to achieving a commercially reasonable resolution. If no such resolution can be reached, we will, at our sole discretion, either not appoint the new Sub-Processor, or permit you to suspend or terminate the affected Subscription Service in accordance with the termination provisions of the Agreement without liability to either party (but without prejudice to any fees incurred by you prior to suspension or termination).  \n  \nWhere we engage Sub-Processors, we will impose data protection terms on the Sub-Processors that provide at least the same level of protection for Personal Data as those in this DPA, to the extent applicable to the nature of the services provided by such Sub-Processors. We will remain responsible for each Sub-Processor’s compliance with the obligations of this DPA and for any acts or omissions of such Sub-Processor that cause us to breach any of its obligations under this DPA.\n\n  \n\n6\\. Data Transfers\n------------------\n\n  \nYou acknowledge and agree that we may access and Process Personal Data on a global basis as necessary to provide the Subscription Service in accordance with the Agreement, and in particular that Personal Data may be transferred to and Processed by Artisan AI, Inc. in the United States and to other jurisdictions where Artisan AI Affiliates and Sub-Processors have operations. Wherever Personal Data is transferred outside its country of origin, each party will ensure such transfers are made in compliance with the requirements of Data Protection Laws.\n\n  \n\n7\\. Demonstration of Compliance\n-------------------------------\n\n  \nWe will make all information reasonably necessary to demonstrate compliance with this DPA available to you and allow for and contribute to audits, including inspections conducted by you or your auditor in order to assess compliance with this DPA, where required by applicable law. You acknowledge and agree that you will exercise your audit rights under this DPA by instructing us to comply with the audit measures described in this ‘Demonstration of Compliance’ section. At your written request, we will provide written responses (on a confidential basis) to all reasonable requests for information made by you necessary to confirm our compliance with this DPA, provided that you will not exercise this right more than once per calendar year unless you have reasonable grounds to suspect non-compliance with the DPA.\n\n  \n\n8\\. Additional Provisions for California Personal Information\n-------------------------------------------------------------\n\n  \na. Scope. The ‘Additional Provisions for California Personal Information’ section of the DPA will apply only with respect to California Personal Information.  \n  \nb. Roles of the Parties. When processing California Personal Information in accordance with your Instructions, the parties acknowledge and agree that you are a Business and we are a Service Provider for the purposes of the CCPA.  \n  \nc. Responsibilities. We certify that we will Process California Personal Information as a Service Provider strictly for the purpose of performing the Subscription Services and Consulting Services under the Agreement (the “Business Purpose”) or as otherwise permitted by the CCPA, including as described in the ‘Usage Data’ section of our Privacy Policy. Further, we certify we i) will not Sell or Share California Personal Information; (ii) will not Process California Personal Information outside the direct business relationship between the parties, unless required by applicable law; and (iii) will not combine the California Personal Information included in Customer Data with personal information that we collect or receive from another source (other than information we receive from another source in connection with our obligations as a Service Provider under the Agreement).  \n  \nd. Compliance. We will (i) comply with obligations applicable to us as a Service Provider under the CCPA and (ii) provide California Personal Information with the same level of privacy protection as is required by the CCPA. We will notify you if we make a determination that we can no longer meet our obligations as a Service Provider under the CCPA.  \n  \ne. CCPA Audits. You will have the right to take reasonable and appropriate steps to help ensure that we use California Personal Information in a manner consistent with Customer’s obligations under the CCPA. Upon notice, you will have the right to take reasonable and appropriate steps in accordance with the Agreement to stop and remediate unauthorized use of California Personal Information.  \n  \nf. Not a Sale. The parties acknowledge and agree that the disclosure of California Personal Information by the Customer to Artisan AI does not form part of any monetary or other valuable consideration exchanged between the parties.\n\n  \n\n9\\. General Provisions\n----------------------\n\n  \na. Amendments. Notwithstanding anything else to the contrary in the Agreement and without prejudice to the ‘Compliance with Instructions’ or ‘Security’ sections of this DPA, we reserve the right to make any updates and changes to this DPA and the terms that apply in the ‘Amendment; No Waiver’ section of the General Terms will apply.  \n  \nb. Severability. If any individual provisions of this DPA are determined to be invalid or unenforceable, the validity and enforceability of the other provisions of this DPA will not be affected.  \n  \nc. Limitation of Liability. Each party and each of their Affiliates’ liability, taken in aggregate, arising out of or related to this DPA (including any other DPAs between the parties) and the Standard Contractual Clauses, where applicable, whether in contract, tort or under any other theory of liability, will be subject to the limitations and exclusions of liability set out in the ‘Limitation of Liability’ section of the General Terms and any reference in such section to the liability of a party means aggregate liability of that party and all of its Affiliates under the Agreement (including this DPA). For the avoidance of doubt, if Artisan AI, Inc. is not a party to the Agreement, the ‘Limitation of Liability’ section of the General Terms will apply as between you and Artisan AI, Inc., and in such respect any references to ‘Artisan AI’, ‘we’, ‘us’ or ‘our’ will include both Artisan AI, Inc. and the Artisan AI entity that is a party to the Agreement. In no event will either party’s liability be limited with respect to any individual’s data protection rights under this DPA (including any other DPAs between the parties and the Standard Contractual Clauses, where applicable) or otherwise.  \n  \nd. Governing Law. This DPA will be governed by and construed in accordance with the ‘Contracting Entity; ‘Applicable Law; Notice’ sections of the Jurisdiction Specific Terms, unless required otherwise by Data Protection Laws.\n\n  \n\n10\\. Parties to this DPA\n------------------------\n\n  \na. Permitted Affiliates. By signing the Agreement, you enter into this DPA (including, where applicable, the Standard Contractual Clauses) on behalf of yourself and in the name and on behalf of your Permitted Affiliates. For the purposes of this DPA only, and except where indicated otherwise, the terms “Customer”, “you” and “your” will include you and such Permitted Affiliates.  \n  \nb. Authorization. The legal entity agreeing to this DPA as Customer represents that it is authorized to agree to and enter into this DPA for and on behalf of itself and, as applicable, each of its Permitted Affiliates.  \n  \nc. Remedies. The parties agree that (i) solely the Customer entity that is the contracting party to the Agreement will exercise any right or seek any remedy any Permitted Affiliate may have under this DPA on behalf of its Affiliates, and (ii) the Customer entity that is the contracting party to the Agreement will exercise any such rights under this DPA not separately for each Permitted Affiliate individually but in a combined manner for itself and all of its Permitted Affiliates together. The Customer entity that is the contracting entity is responsible for coordinating all Instructions, authorizations and communications with us under the DPA and will be entitled to make and receive any communications related to this DPA on behalf of its Permitted Affiliates.  \n  \nd. Other rights. The parties agree that you will, when reviewing our compliance with this DPA pursuant to the ‘Demonstration of Compliance’ section, take all reasonable measures to limit any impact on us and our Affiliates by combining several audit requests carried out on behalf of the Customer entity that is the contracting party to the Agreement and all of its Permitted Affiliates in one single audit.\n\n  \n\nAnnex 1 – Details of Processing\n-------------------------------\n\n  \nA.

All capitalized terms not otherwise defined herein will have the meanings as set forth in the General Terms.  \n  \na) Access Control  \n  \ni) Preventing Unauthorized Product Access  \n  \nOutsourced processing: We host our Service with outsourced cloud infrastructure providers. Additionally, we maintain contractual relationships with vendors in order to provide the Service in accordance with our DPA. We rely on contractual agreements, privacy policies, and vendor compliance programs in order to protect data processed or stored by these vendors.  \n  \nPhysical and environmental security: We host our product infrastructure with multi-tenant, outsourced infrastructure providers. We do not own or maintain hardware located at the outsourced infrastructure providers’ data centers. Production servers and client-facing applications are logically and physically secured from our internal corporate information systems. The physical and environmental security controls are currently being audited for SOC 2 Type II and ISO 27001 compliance, among other certifications.  \n  \nAuthentication: We implement a uniform password policy for our customer products. Customers who interact with the products via the user interface must authenticate before accessing non-public customer data.  \n  \nAuthorization: Customer Data is stored in multi-tenant storage systems accessible to Customers via only application user interfaces and application programming interfaces. Customers are not allowed direct access to the underlying application infrastructure. The authorization model in each of our products is designed to ensure that only the appropriately assigned individuals can access relevant features, views, and customization options. Authorization to data sets is performed through validating the user’s permissions against the attributes associated with each data set.  \n  \nApplication Programming Interface (API) access: Public product APIs may be accessed using an API key or through Oauth authorization.  \n  \nii) Preventing Unauthorized Product Use  \n  \nWe implement industry standard access controls and detection capabilities for the internal networks that support its products.  \n  \nAccess controls: Network access control mechanisms are designed to prevent network traffic using unauthorized protocols from reaching the product infrastructure. The technical measures implemented differ between infrastructure providers and include Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) implementations, security group assignment, and traditional firewall rules.  \n  \nIntrusion detection and prevention: We implement a Web Application Firewall (WAF) solution to protect hosted customer websites and other internet-accessible applications. The WAF is designed to identify and prevent attacks against publicly available network services.  \n  \nStatic code analysis: Code stored in our source code repositories is checked for best practices and identifiable software flaws using automated tooling.  \n  \nPenetration testing: We maintain relationships with industry-recognized penetration testing service providers for penetration testing of both the Artisan AI web application and internal corporate network infrastructure at least annually. The intent of these penetration tests is to identify security vulnerabilities and mitigate the risk and business impact they pose to the in-scope systems.  \n  \nBug bounty: A bug bounty program invites and incentivizes independent security researchers to ethically discover and disclose security flaws. We implement a bug bounty program in an effort to widen the available opportunities to engage with the security community and improve the product defenses against sophisticated attacks.  \n  \niii) Limitations of Privilege & Authorization Requirements  \n  \nProduct access: A subset of our employees have access to the products and to customer data via controlled interfaces. The intent of providing access to a subset of employees is to provide effective customer support, product development and research, to troubleshoot potential problems, to detect and respond to security incidents and implement data security. Access is enabled through “just in time” (JITA) requests for access; all such requests are logged. Employees are granted access by role, and reviews of high risk privilege grants are initiated daily. Administrative or high risk access permissions are reviewed at least once every six months.  \n  \nBackground checks: Where permitted by applicable law, Artisan AI employees undergo a third-party background or reference checks. In the United States, employment offers are contingent upon the results of a third-party background check. All Artisan AI employees are required to conduct themselves in a manner consistent with company guidelines, non-disclosure requirements, and ethical standards.  \n  \nb) Transmission Control  \n  \nIn-transit: We require HTTPS encryption (also referred to as SSL or TLS) on all login interfaces and for free on every customer site hosted on the Artisan AI products. Our HTTPS implementation uses industry standard algorithms and certificates.  \n  \nAt-rest: We store user passwords following policies that follow industry standard practices for security. We have implemented technologies to ensure that stored data is encrypted at rest.  \n  \nc) Input Control  \n  \nDetection: We designed our infrastructure to log extensive information about the system behavior, traffic received, system authentication, and other application requests. Internal systems aggregate log data and alert appropriate employees of malicious, unintended, or anomalous activities. Our personnel, including security, operations, and support personnel, are responsive to known incidents.  \n  \nResponse and tracking: We maintain a record of known security incidents that includes description, dates and times of relevant activities, and incident disposition. Suspected and confirmed security incidents are investigated by security, operations, or support personnel; and appropriate resolution steps are identified and documented. For any confirmed incidents, we will take appropriate steps to minimize product and Customer damage or unauthorized disclosure. Notification to you will be in accordance with the terms of the Agreement.  \n  \nd) Availability Control  \n  \nInfrastructure availability: The infrastructure providers use commercially reasonable efforts to ensure a minimum of 99.95% uptime. The providers maintain a minimum of N+1 redundancy to power, network, and heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) services.  \n  \nFault tolerance: Backup and replication strategies are designed to ensure redundancy and fail-over protections during a significant processing failure. Customer data is backed up to multiple durable data stores and replicated across multiple availability zones.  \n  \nOnline replicas and backups: Where feasible, production databases are designed to replicate data between no less than 1 primary and 1 secondary database. All databases are backed up and maintained using at least industry standard methods.  \n  \nDisaster Recovery Plans: We maintain and regularly test disaster recovery plans to help ensure availability of information following interruption to, or failure of, critical business processes.  \n  \nOur products are designed to ensure redundancy and seamless failover. The server instances that support the products are also architected with a goal to prevent single points of failure. This design assists our operations in maintaining and updating the product applications and backend while limiting downtime.\n\n  \n\nAnnex 3 – Sub-Processors\n------------------------\n\n  \nTo help Artisan AI deliver the Subscription Service, we engage Sub-Processors to assist with our data processing activities.

Artisan AI Obligations\n--------------------------\n\n  \na. Compliance with Instructions. We will only Process Personal Data for the purposes described in this DPA or as otherwise agreed within the scope of your lawful Instructions, except where and to the extent otherwise required by applicable law.

If we become aware that we cannot Process Personal Data in accordance with your Instructions due to a legal requirement under any applicable law, we will (i) promptly notify you of that legal requirement to the extent permitted by the applicable law; and (ii) where necessary, cease all Processing (other than merely storing and maintaining the security of the affected Personal Data) until such time as you issue new Instructions with which we are able to comply. If this provision is invoked, we will not be liable to you under the Agreement for any failure to perform the applicable Subscription Services until such time as you issue new lawful Instructions with regard to the Processing.  \n  \nc. Security. We will implement and maintain appropriate technical and organizational measures to protect Personal Data from Personal Data Breaches, as described under Annex 2 to this DPA (“Security Measures”). Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary, we may modify or update the Security Measures at our discretion provided that such modification or update does not result in a material degradation in the protection offered by the Security Measures.  \n  \nd. Confidentiality. We will ensure that any personnel whom we authorize to Process Personal Data on our behalf is subject to appropriate confidentiality obligations (whether a contractual or statutory duty) with respect to that Personal Data.  \n  \ne. Personal Data Breaches. We will notify you without undue delay after we become aware of any Personal Data Breach and will provide timely information relating to the Personal Data Breach as it becomes known or reasonably requested by you. At your request, we will promptly provide you with such reasonable assistance as necessary to enable you to notify relevant Personal Data Breaches to competent authorities and/or affected Data Subjects, if you are required to do so under Data Protection Laws.  \n  \nf. Deletion or Return of Personal Data. We will delete or return all Customer Data, including Personal Data (including copies thereof) Processed pursuant to this DPA, on termination or expiration of your Subscription Service. This term will apply except where we are required by applicable law to retain some or all of the Customer Data, or where we have archived Customer Data on back-up systems, which data we will securely isolate and protect from any further Processing and delete in accordance with our deletion practices. You may request the deletion of your Artisan AI account after expiration or termination of your subscription by emailing [hello@artisan.co](mailto:hello@artisan.co)\n.  \n  \nIf you need help retrieving your Customer Data during the Subscription Term, we will provide reasonable assistance to you, at your cost, and in accordance with the ‘Confidentiality’ section of the General Terms.\n\n  \n\n4\\. Data Subject Requests\n-------------------------\n\n  \nThe Subscription Service provides you with a number of controls that you can use to retrieve, correct, delete or restrict Personal Data, which you can use to assist it in connection with its obligations under Data Protection Laws, including your obligations relating to responding to requests from Data Subjects to exercise their rights under applicable Data Protection Laws (“Data Subject Requests”).  \n  \nTo the extent that you are unable to independently address a Data Subject Request through the Subscription Service, then upon your written request we will provide reasonable assistance to you to respond to any Data Subject Requests or requests from data protection authorities relating to the Processing of Personal Data under the Agreement. You will reimburse us for the commercially reasonable costs arising from this assistance.  \n  \nIf a Data Subject Request or other communication regarding the Processing of Personal Data under the Agreement is made directly to us, we will promptly inform you and will advise the Data Subject to submit their request to you. You will be solely responsible for responding substantively to any such Data Subject Requests or communications involving Personal Data.\n\n  \n\n5\\. Sub-Processors\n------------------\n\n  \nYou agree we may engage Sub-Processors to Process Personal Data on your behalf, and we do so in three ways. First, we may engage Sub-Processors to assist us with hosting and infrastructure. Second, we may engage with Sub-Processors to support product features and integrations. Third, we may engage with Artisan AI Affiliates as Sub-Processors for service and support. Some Sub-Processors will apply to you as default, and some Sub-Processors will apply only if you opt-in.  \n  \nWe have currently appointed, as Sub-Processors, the third parties and Artisan AI Affiliates listed in Annex 3 to this DPA. You may subscribe to receive notifications by email if we add or replace any Sub-Processors by emailing [hello@artisan.co](mailto:hello@artisan.co)\n. If you opt-in to receive such email, we will notify you at least 30 days prior to any such change.  \n  \nWe will give you the opportunity to object to the engagement of new Sub-Processors on reasonable grounds relating to the protection of Personal Data within 30 days of notifying you. If you do notify us of such an objection, the parties will discuss your concerns in good faith with a view to achieving a commercially reasonable resolution. If no such resolution can be reached, we will, at our sole discretion, either not appoint the new Sub-Processor, or permit you to suspend or terminate the affected Subscription Service in accordance with the termination provisions of the Agreement without liability to either party (but without prejudice to any fees incurred by you prior to suspension or termination).  \n  \nWhere we engage Sub-Processors, we will impose data protection terms on the Sub-Processors that provide at least the same level of protection for Personal Data as those in this DPA, to the extent applicable to the nature of the services provided by such Sub-Processors. We will remain responsible for each Sub-Processor’s compliance with the obligations of this DPA and for any acts or omissions of such Sub-Processor that cause us to breach any of its obligations under this DPA.\n\n  \n\n6\\. Data Transfers\n------------------\n\n  \nYou acknowledge and agree that we may access and Process Personal Data on a global basis as necessary to provide the Subscription Service in accordance with the Agreement, and in particular that Personal Data may be transferred to and Processed by Artisan AI, Inc. in the United States and to other jurisdictions where Artisan AI Affiliates and Sub-Processors have operations. Wherever Personal Data is transferred outside its country of origin, each party will ensure such transfers are made in compliance with the requirements of Data Protection Laws.\n\n  \n\n7\\. Demonstration of Compliance\n-------------------------------\n\n  \nWe will make all information reasonably necessary to demonstrate compliance with this DPA available to you and allow for and contribute to audits, including inspections conducted by you or your auditor in order to assess compliance with this DPA, where required by applicable law. You acknowledge and agree that you will exercise your audit rights under this DPA by instructing us to comply with the audit measures described in this ‘Demonstration of Compliance’ section. At your written request, we will provide written responses (on a confidential basis) to all reasonable requests for information made by you necessary to confirm our compliance with this DPA, provided that you will not exercise this right more than once per calendar year unless you have reasonable grounds to suspect non-compliance with the DPA.\n\n  \n\n8\\. Additional Provisions for California Personal Information\n-------------------------------------------------------------\n\n  \na. Scope. The ‘Additional Provisions for California Personal Information’ section of the DPA will apply only with respect to California Personal Information.  \n  \nb. Roles of the Parties. When processing California Personal Information in accordance with your Instructions, the parties acknowledge and agree that you are a Business and we are a Service Provider for the purposes of the CCPA.  \n  \nc. Responsibilities. We certify that we will Process California Personal Information as a Service Provider strictly for the purpose of performing the Subscription Services and Consulting Services under the Agreement (the “Business Purpose”) or as otherwise permitted by the CCPA, including as described in the ‘Usage Data’ section of our Privacy Policy. Further, we certify we i) will not Sell or Share California Personal Information; (ii) will not Process California Personal Information outside the direct business relationship between the parties, unless required by applicable law; and (iii) will not combine the California Personal Information included in Customer Data with personal information that we collect or receive from another source (other than information we receive from another source in connection with our obligations as a Service Provider under the Agreement).  \n  \nd. Compliance. We will (i) comply with obligations applicable to us as a Service Provider under the CCPA and (ii) provide California Personal Information with the same level of privacy protection as is required by the CCPA. We will notify you if we make a determination that we can no longer meet our obligations as a Service Provider under the CCPA.  \n  \ne. CCPA Audits. You will have the right to take reasonable and appropriate steps to help ensure that we use California Personal Information in a manner consistent with Customer’s obligations under the CCPA. Upon notice, you will have the right to take reasonable and appropriate steps in accordance with the Agreement to stop and remediate unauthorized use of California Personal Information.  \n  \nf. Not a Sale. The parties acknowledge and agree that the disclosure of California Personal Information by the Customer to Artisan AI does not form part of any monetary or other valuable consideration exchanged between the parties.\n\n  \n\n9\\. General Provisions\n----------------------\n\n  \na. Amendments. Notwithstanding anything else to the contrary in the Agreement and without prejudice to the ‘Compliance with Instructions’ or ‘Security’ sections of this DPA, we reserve the right to make any updates and changes to this DPA and the terms that apply in the ‘Amendment; No Waiver’ section of the General Terms will apply.  \n  \nb. Severability. If any individual provisions of this DPA are determined to be invalid or unenforceable, the validity and enforceability of the other provisions of this DPA will not be affected.  \n  \nc. Limitation of Liability. Each party and each of their Affiliates’ liability, taken in aggregate, arising out of or related to this DPA (including any other DPAs between the parties) and the Standard Contractual Clauses, where applicable, whether in contract, tort or under any other theory of liability, will be subject to the limitations and exclusions of liability set out in the ‘Limitation of Liability’ section of the General Terms and any reference in such section to the liability of a party means aggregate liability of that party and all of its Affiliates under the Agreement (including this DPA). For the avoidance of doubt, if Artisan AI, Inc. is not a party to the Agreement, the ‘Limitation of Liability’ section of the General Terms will apply as between you and Artisan AI, Inc., and in such respect any references to ‘Artisan AI’, ‘we’, ‘us’ or ‘our’ will include both Artisan AI, Inc. and the Artisan AI entity that is a party to the Agreement. In no event will either party’s liability be limited with respect to any individual’s data protection rights under this DPA (including any other DPAs between the parties and the Standard Contractual Clauses, where applicable) or otherwise.  \n  \nd. Governing Law. This DPA will be governed by and construed in accordance with the ‘Contracting Entity; ‘Applicable Law; Notice’ sections of the Jurisdiction Specific Terms, unless required otherwise by Data Protection Laws.\n\n  \n\n10\\. Parties to this DPA\n------------------------\n\n  \na. Permitted Affiliates. By signing the Agreement, you enter into this DPA (including, where applicable, the Standard Contractual Clauses) on behalf of yourself and in the name and on behalf of your Permitted Affiliates. For the purposes of this DPA only, and except where indicated otherwise, the terms “Customer”, “you” and “your” will include you and such Permitted Affiliates.  \n  \nb. Authorization. The legal entity agreeing to this DPA as Customer represents that it is authorized to agree to and enter into this DPA for and on behalf of itself and, as applicable, each of its Permitted Affiliates.  \n  \nc. Remedies. The parties agree that (i) solely the Customer entity that is the contracting party to the Agreement will exercise any right or seek any remedy any Permitted Affiliate may have under this DPA on behalf of its Affiliates, and (ii) the Customer entity that is the contracting party to the Agreement will exercise any such rights under this DPA not separately for each Permitted Affiliate individually but in a combined manner for itself and all of its Permitted Affiliates together. The Customer entity that is the contracting entity is responsible for coordinating all Instructions, authorizations and communications with us under the DPA and will be entitled to make and receive any communications related to this DPA on behalf of its Permitted Affiliates.  \n  \nd. Other rights. The parties agree that you will, when reviewing our compliance with this DPA pursuant to the ‘Demonstration of Compliance’ section, take all reasonable measures to limit any impact on us and our Affiliates by combining several audit requests carried out on behalf of the Customer entity that is the contracting party to the Agreement and all of its Permitted Affiliates in one single audit.\n\n  \n\nAnnex 1 – Details of Processing\n-------------------------------\n\n  \nA.

All capitalized terms not otherwise defined herein will have the meanings as set forth in the General Terms.  \n  \na) Access Control  \n  \ni) Preventing Unauthorized Product Access  \n  \nOutsourced processing: We host our Service with outsourced cloud infrastructure providers. Additionally, we maintain contractual relationships with vendors in order to provide the Service in accordance with our DPA. We rely on contractual agreements, privacy policies, and vendor compliance programs in order to protect data processed or stored by these vendors.  \n  \nPhysical and environmental security: We host our product infrastructure with multi-tenant, outsourced infrastructure providers. We do not own or maintain hardware located at the outsourced infrastructure providers’ data centers. Production servers and client-facing applications are logically and physically secured from our internal corporate information systems. The physical and environmental security controls are currently being audited for SOC 2 Type II and ISO 27001 compliance, among other certifications.  \n  \nAuthentication: We implement a uniform password policy for our customer products. Customers who interact with the products via the user interface must authenticate before accessing non-public customer data.  \n  \nAuthorization: Customer Data is stored in multi-tenant storage systems accessible to Customers via only application user interfaces and application programming interfaces. Customers are not allowed direct access to the underlying application infrastructure. The authorization model in each of our products is designed to ensure that only the appropriately assigned individuals can access relevant features, views, and customization options. Authorization to data sets is performed through validating the user’s permissions against the attributes associated with each data set.  \n  \nApplication Programming Interface (API) access: Public product APIs may be accessed using an API key or through Oauth authorization.  \n  \nii) Preventing Unauthorized Product Use  \n  \nWe implement industry standard access controls and detection capabilities for the internal networks that support its products.  \n  \nAccess controls: Network access control mechanisms are designed to prevent network traffic using unauthorized protocols from reaching the product infrastructure. The technical measures implemented differ between infrastructure providers and include Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) implementations, security group assignment, and traditional firewall rules.  \n  \nIntrusion detection and prevention: We implement a Web Application Firewall (WAF) solution to protect hosted customer websites and other internet-accessible applications. The WAF is designed to identify and prevent attacks against publicly available network services.  \n  \nStatic code analysis: Code stored in our source code repositories is checked for best practices and identifiable software flaws using automated tooling.  \n  \nPenetration testing: We maintain relationships with industry-recognized penetration testing service providers for penetration testing of both the Artisan AI web application and internal corporate network infrastructure at least annually. The intent of these penetration tests is to identify security vulnerabilities and mitigate the risk and business impact they pose to the in-scope systems.  \n  \nBug bounty: A bug bounty program invites and incentivizes independent security researchers to ethically discover and disclose security flaws. We implement a bug bounty program in an effort to widen the available opportunities to engage with the security community and improve the product defenses against sophisticated attacks.  \n  \niii) Limitations of Privilege & Authorization Requirements  \n  \nProduct access: A subset of our employees have access to the products and to customer data via controlled interfaces. The intent of providing access to a subset of employees is to provide effective customer support, product development and research, to troubleshoot potential problems, to detect and respond to security incidents and implement data security. Access is enabled through “just in time” (JITA) requests for access; all such requests are logged. Employees are granted access by role, and reviews of high risk privilege grants are initiated daily. Administrative or high risk access permissions are reviewed at least once every six months.  \n  \nBackground checks: Where permitted by applicable law, Artisan AI employees undergo a third-party background or reference checks. In the United States, employment offers are contingent upon the results of a third-party background check. All Artisan AI employees are required to conduct themselves in a manner consistent with company guidelines, non-disclosure requirements, and ethical standards.  \n  \nb) Transmission Control  \n  \nIn-transit: We require HTTPS encryption (also referred to as SSL or TLS) on all login interfaces and for free on every customer site hosted on the Artisan AI products. Our HTTPS implementation uses industry standard algorithms and certificates.  \n  \nAt-rest: We store user passwords following policies that follow industry standard practices for security. We have implemented technologies to ensure that stored data is encrypted at rest.  \n  \nc) Input Control  \n  \nDetection: We designed our infrastructure to log extensive information about the system behavior, traffic received, system authentication, and other application requests. Internal systems aggregate log data and alert appropriate employees of malicious, unintended, or anomalous activities. Our personnel, including security, operations, and support personnel, are responsive to known incidents.  \n  \nResponse and tracking: We maintain a record of known security incidents that includes description, dates and times of relevant activities, and incident disposition. Suspected and confirmed security incidents are investigated by security, operations, or support personnel; and appropriate resolution steps are identified and documented. For any confirmed incidents, we will take appropriate steps to minimize product and Customer damage or unauthorized disclosure. Notification to you will be in accordance with the terms of the Agreement.  \n  \nd) Availability Control  \n  \nInfrastructure availability: The infrastructure providers use commercially reasonable efforts to ensure a minimum of 99.95% uptime. The providers maintain a minimum of N+1 redundancy to power, network, and heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) services.  \n  \nFault tolerance: Backup and replication strategies are designed to ensure redundancy and fail-over protections during a significant processing failure. Customer data is backed up to multiple durable data stores and replicated across multiple availability zones.  \n  \nOnline replicas and backups: Where feasible, production databases are designed to replicate data between no less than 1 primary and 1 secondary database. All databases are backed up and maintained using at least industry standard methods.  \n  \nDisaster Recovery Plans: We maintain and regularly test disaster recovery plans to help ensure availability of information following interruption to, or failure of, critical business processes.  \n  \nOur products are designed to ensure redundancy and seamless failover. The server instances that support the products are also architected with a goal to prevent single points of failure. This design assists our operations in maintaining and updating the product applications and backend while limiting downtime.\n\n  \n\nAnnex 3 – Sub-Processors\n------------------------\n\n  \nTo help Artisan AI deliver the Subscription Service, we engage Sub-Processors to assist with our data processing activities.

DISPUTE RESOLUTION**\n---------------------------\n\n**  \nInformal Negotiations  \n  \n**To expedite resolution and control the cost of any dispute, controversy, or claim related to these Legal Terms (each a \"Dispute\" and collectively, the \"Disputes\") brought by either you or us (individually, a \"Party\" and collectively, the \"Parties\"), the Parties agree to first attempt to negotiate any Dispute (except those Disputes expressly provided below) informally for at least thirty (30)days before initiating arbitration. Such informal negotiations commence upon written notice from one Party to the other Party.  \n  \n**Binding Arbitration  \n  \n**If the Parties are unable to resolve a Dispute through informal negotiations, the Dispute (except those Disputes expressly excluded below) will be finally and exclusively resolved by binding arbitration. YOU UNDERSTAND THAT WITHOUT THIS PROVISION, YOU WOULD HAVE THE RIGHT TO SUE IN COURT AND HAVE A JURY TRIAL. The arbitration shall be commenced and conducted under the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association (\"AAA\") and, where appropriate, the AAA’s Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes (\"AAA Consumer Rules\"), both of which are available at the [American Arbitration Association (AAA) website](http://www.adr.org/)\n. Your arbitration fees and your share of arbitrator compensation shall be governed by the AAA Consumer Rules and, where appropriate, limited by the AAA Consumer Rules. The arbitration may be conducted in person, through the submission of documents, by phone, or online. The arbitrator will make a decision in writing, but need not provide a statement of reasons unless requested by either Party. The arbitrator must follow applicable law, and any award may be challenged if the arbitrator fails to do so. Except where otherwise required by the applicable AAA rules or applicable law, the arbitration will take place in California. Except as otherwise provided herein, the Parties may litigate in court to compel arbitration, stay proceedings pending arbitration, or to confirm, modify, vacate, or enter judgment on the award entered by the arbitrator.  \n  \nIf for any reason, a Dispute proceeds in court rather than arbitration, the Dispute shall be commenced or prosecuted in the state and federal courts located in California, and the Parties hereby consent to, and waive all defenses of lack of personal jurisdiction, and forum non conveniens with respect to venue and jurisdiction in such state and federal courts. Application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods and the Uniform Computer Information Transaction Act (UCITA) are excluded from these Legal Terms.  \n  \nIn no event shall any Dispute brought by either Party related in any way to the Services be commenced more than one (1)years after the cause of action arose. If this provision is found to be illegal or unenforceable, then neither Party will elect to arbitrate any Dispute falling within that portion of this provision found to be illegal or unenforceable and such Dispute shall be decided by a court of competent jurisdiction within the courts listed for jurisdiction above, and the Parties agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of that court.  \n  \n**Restrictions  \n  \n**The Parties agree that any arbitration shall be limited to the Dispute between the Parties individually. To the full extent permitted by law, (a) no arbitration shall be joined with any other proceeding; (b) there is no right or authority for any Dispute to be arbitrated on a class-action basis or to utilize class action procedures; and (c) there is no right or authority for any Dispute to be brought in a purported representative capacity on behalf of the general public or any other persons.  \n  \n**Exceptions to Informal Negotiations and Arbitration  \n  \n**The Parties agree that the following Disputes are not subject to the above provisions concerning informal negotiations binding arbitration: (a) any Disputes seeking to enforce or protect, or concerning the validity of, any of the intellectual property rights of a Party; (b) any Dispute related to, or arising from, allegations of theft, piracy, invasion of privacy, or unauthorized use; and (c) any claim for injunctive relief. If this provision is found to be illegal or unenforceable, then neither Party will elect to arbitrate any Dispute falling within that portion of this provision found to be illegal or unenforceable and such Dispute shall be decided by a court of competent jurisdiction within the courts listed for jurisdiction above, and the Parties agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of that court.  \n  \n\n  \n\n**21\\. CORRECTIONS**\n--------------------\n\n  \nThere may be information on the Services that contains typographical errors, inaccuracies, or omissions, including descriptions, pricing, availability, and various other information.

DISPUTE RESOLUTION**\n---------------------------\n\n**  \nInformal Negotiations  \n  \n**To expedite resolution and control the cost of any dispute, controversy, or claim related to these Legal Terms (each a \"Dispute\" and collectively, the \"Disputes\") brought by either you or us (individually, a \"Party\" and collectively, the \"Parties\"), the Parties agree to first attempt to negotiate any Dispute (except those Disputes expressly provided below) informally for at least thirty (30)days before initiating arbitration. Such informal negotiations commence upon written notice from one Party to the other Party.  \n  \n**Binding Arbitration  \n  \n**If the Parties are unable to resolve a Dispute through informal negotiations, the Dispute (except those Disputes expressly excluded below) will be finally and exclusively resolved by binding arbitration. YOU UNDERSTAND THAT WITHOUT THIS PROVISION, YOU WOULD HAVE THE RIGHT TO SUE IN COURT AND HAVE A JURY TRIAL. The arbitration shall be commenced and conducted under the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association (\"AAA\") and, where appropriate, the AAA’s Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes (\"AAA Consumer Rules\"), both of which are available at the [American Arbitration Association (AAA) website](http://www.adr.org/)\n. Your arbitration fees and your share of arbitrator compensation shall be governed by the AAA Consumer Rules and, where appropriate, limited by the AAA Consumer Rules. The arbitration may be conducted in person, through the submission of documents, by phone, or online. The arbitrator will make a decision in writing, but need not provide a statement of reasons unless requested by either Party. The arbitrator must follow applicable law, and any award may be challenged if the arbitrator fails to do so. Except where otherwise required by the applicable AAA rules or applicable law, the arbitration will take place in California. Except as otherwise provided herein, the Parties may litigate in court to compel arbitration, stay proceedings pending arbitration, or to confirm, modify, vacate, or enter judgment on the award entered by the arbitrator.  \n  \nIf for any reason, a Dispute proceeds in court rather than arbitration, the Dispute shall be commenced or prosecuted in the state and federal courts located in California, and the Parties hereby consent to, and waive all defenses of lack of personal jurisdiction, and forum non conveniens with respect to venue and jurisdiction in such state and federal courts. Application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods and the Uniform Computer Information Transaction Act (UCITA) are excluded from these Legal Terms.  \n  \nIn no event shall any Dispute brought by either Party related in any way to the Services be commenced more than one (1)years after the cause of action arose. If this provision is found to be illegal or unenforceable, then neither Party will elect to arbitrate any Dispute falling within that portion of this provision found to be illegal or unenforceable and such Dispute shall be decided by a court of competent jurisdiction within the courts listed for jurisdiction above, and the Parties agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of that court.  \n  \n**Restrictions  \n  \n**The Parties agree that any arbitration shall be limited to the Dispute between the Parties individually. To the full extent permitted by law, (a) no arbitration shall be joined with any other proceeding; (b) there is no right or authority for any Dispute to be arbitrated on a class-action basis or to utilize class action procedures; and (c) there is no right or authority for any Dispute to be brought in a purported representative capacity on behalf of the general public or any other persons.  \n  \n**Exceptions to Informal Negotiations and Arbitration  \n  \n**The Parties agree that the following Disputes are not subject to the above provisions concerning informal negotiations binding arbitration: (a) any Disputes seeking to enforce or protect, or concerning the validity of, any of the intellectual property rights of a Party; (b) any Dispute related to, or arising from, allegations of theft, piracy, invasion of privacy, or unauthorized use; and (c) any claim for injunctive relief. If this provision is found to be illegal or unenforceable, then neither Party will elect to arbitrate any Dispute falling within that portion of this provision found to be illegal or unenforceable and such Dispute shall be decided by a court of competent jurisdiction within the courts listed for jurisdiction above, and the Parties agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of that court.  \n  \n\n  \n\n**21\\. CORRECTIONS**\n--------------------\n\n  \nThere may be information on the Services that contains typographical errors, inaccuracies, or omissions, including descriptions, pricing, availability, and various other information.

[Dealroom reports](https://dealroom.co/guides/saas)\n that 47% of all venture capital in 2023 was invested in SaaS platforms. \n\n  \n\nThis is because SaaS outsources traditional software's limitations (updating, installation, integration), making adoption more manageable, flexible, and cost-effective. \n\n  \n\nHowever, your sales team might need help mapping a new sales process tied to subscription-based software–help outlining a unique value proposition, tracking metrics, or looking for ways to upsell an existing customer base.\n\n  \n\nThis article discusses the four best sales models for B2B SaaS products and how they can help you pivot your sales know-how into one of the biggest markets in tech.\n\n  \n\nHow Is SaaS Sales Different From Traditional Sales Models?\n----------------------------------------------------------\n\nBusinesses love SaaS tools because they are easy. Do you want to stay flexible? Cloud tools can help. Want to get an entire team onboarded quickly? SaaS solutions make it easy. Need to get away from downloadables, updates, and patches? SaaS is the way. \n\n  \n\nThese reasons are probably why [99% of companies will use at least one SaaS solution by the end of 2024](https://www.saasacademy.com/blog/saas-statistics)\n. \n\n  \n\nHow does SaaS make all of this possible?\n\n  \n\n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **They are a move to subscription-based purchases** rather than one-time purchases. Rather than licensing and downloads, SaaS solutions rely on monthly or annual payments, providing more opportunities to upgrade or upsell paying customers.\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **SaaS deployment provides always-on web services via a web browser**. This makes software much more accessible (everyone has a web browser) and minimizes the need for users to update or upgrade software constantly.\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    SaaS includes a maintenance model that **outsources critical functions like updates, upgrades, or security and compliance issues to the software provider**. \n    \n      \n    \n\n  \n\nAnd when the technology changes, sales will follow. Instead of focusing on a one-time transactional sales model, your sales team will look at a shorter sales cycle and a revenue model reflecting earnings over time rather than at the point of sale.  \n\n  \n\nAdditionally, new features can translate into new subscription tiers, providing sales teams plenty of opportunities to upsell existing customers.  \n\n  \n\n### B2B vs. B2C SaaS Sales\n\nB2B SaaS sales will focus on account-based relationships. Instead of seeking mass licenses from a wide range of customers, you’ll look to sell ongoing packages of services and software that fulfill daily enterprise needs. \n\n  \n\nIt’s not just about enterprise users, however. Many small- and mid-sized businesses (SMBs) need comprehensive packages with the flexibility to adjust pricing tiers and features monthly or annually.   \n\n  \n\nThe SaaS Sales Process\n----------------------\n\n![Pipeline](https://www.artisan.co/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.ctfassets.net%2Fkyprwggh4muz%2F6D8Y5RbowveVVzmPpqp4Y7%2F319e6f7f702b73a688330c827f8ae416%2FPipeline.webp&w=3840&q=75)\n\nThere are hundreds of SaaS solutions available for both general consumers and business customers… This market grew to the tune of $101.47B in 2023 and is expected to top [$400B in the next decade](https://www.precedenceresearch.com/software-as-a-service-market#:~:text=The%20U.S.%20software%20as%20a,13.5%25%20from%202024%20to%202034.)\n. That means that there is plenty of room to stake your claim with the right features. \n\n  \n\nThe B2B SaaS sales process is similar to a traditional sales pipeline, albeit considering the unique contours of a SaaS product. \n\n  \n\n### Stage 1: Lead Generation\n\nLead generation (or lead gen) is critical to the B2B SaaS sales process and extends across several contexts and situations. The full scope of lead gen can include:\n\n  \n\n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Inbound marketing,** covering targeted SaaS marketing, SEO content development, webinars, and other indirect approaches that raise your product or brand profile.\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Outbound prospecting** usually includes email campaigns, social media outreach, and participation in SaaS industry events to connect with potential customers and nurture them through a CRM or Artisan's [AI SDR Ava](https://www.artisan.co/ai-sales-agent)\n    .\n    \n      \n    \n\n![Lead Generation](https://www.artisan.co/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.ctfassets.net%2Fkyprwggh4muz%2F6CAtUvP4E7z6TmLoVjAnU3%2F2dd308a33d0615b4323f72163756170c%2FLead_Generation.webp&w=3840&q=75)\n\nIn either case, lead generation efforts should align with your existing Ideal Customer Profile (ICP), which should model new customers and those likely to stay with a product for a long-term commitment.   \n\n  \n\n### Stage 2: Lead Qualification\n\nLead qualification is a foundational part of any sales pipeline. Potential leads should be scored and ranked based on their alignment with your ICP and organizational goals, with metrics including behavioral traits, financial or professional situations, or demographics. \n\n  \n\nOne criteria to use in qualifying leads is the Budget, Authority, Need, and Timeline (BANT) approach:\n\n  \n\n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Budget**: What is the customer’s budget for a SaaS solution? Is it readily available, and are there any financial constraints?\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Authority**: Are you engaging with someone who can make purchasing decisions? Are there one or multiple stakeholders in the decision-making process?\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Need**: What needs does your SaaS solution meet for the customer, and how critical is adoption in terms of time or costs?\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Timeline**: When will the customer be ready to make a purchase? How long do they have for implementation?\n    \n      \n    \n\n### Stage 3: Product Demonstration\n\nProduct demos are among the most valuable and practical sales tools available. [The SaaStr community](https://www.saastr.com/what-is-a-good-demo-conversion-rate-for-saas-startup/#:~:text=10%25%2D20%25.,%2D15%20is%20pretty%20common).)\n reports that the average conversion rate for a product demo is up to 20%—not too bad for a single asset. \n\n  \n\nHowever, not all product demos are created equal. A generic demo can bounce a potential lead faster than anything else. Make sure to customize demos to speak directly to important features to customers (or customer segments). Think interactivity and hands-on demonstrations that show rather than tell. \n\n  \n\nAnswer questions about how your product:\n\n  \n\n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    Simplifies or streamlines everyday tasks for the customer. \n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    Increases productivity through automation or customization.\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    Reduces costs by providing better functionality than their existing solution at a lower price point. \n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    Eases use through onboarding and white-glove support. \n    \n      \n    \n\n  \n\nOften, a demo can include a free or “freemium” version of your SaaS solution that a lead can use on their own time and terms. \n\n  \n\n### Stage 4: Proposal and Negotiation\n\nWhile submitting a proposal might seem like the final step of the sales process, it is better to see this as the first step in negotiations. \n\n  \n\nAny reasonable proposal should include some standard information, including:\n\n  \n\n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **An outline of the terms of the relationship** and the features and capabilities you are delivering to solve specific problems.\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Deliverables** like access to the product, any white-glove customer support services, credits, and so on.\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **A timeline for these deliverables**, including immediate next steps.\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Pricing, payment terms, and deadlines.**\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Case studies and testimonials** that demonstrate costs, ROI, etc.\n    \n      \n    \n\n  \n\nOnce the proposal has been submitted, internal stakeholders will likely have questions about the SaaS solution, such as prices, availability, usefulness, etc. These buyers are making a long-term commitment, and you should be ready and patient with these questions. \n\n  \n\n### Stage 5: Closing Deals\n\nThe proposal has been submitted, questions answered, and now both parties have reached what seems like a deal–if you can close it. \n\n  \n\nYou want to “seal the deal” with an agreement at this stage. Everything, including contracts or paperwork, should be worked out. Many modern companies use digital solutions like DocuSign or Dropbox to allow customers to sign documents automatically. \n\n  \n\nFree or freemium access to your software can create real urgency for your lead to close. If they like it, losing access (or even having limited access) can light a fire under them to close the deal and get their team on the platform.\n\n  \n\nStage 6: Onboarding and Implementation\n--------------------------------------\n\nFinally, once the customer is signed on, provide ongoing support. This should include:\n\n  \n\n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    Training resources and an easily accessible knowledge base.\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    On-call support from your customer service staff. \n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    A dedicated contact point for your customers to ensure they can get problems addressed quickly.\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    IT support to help customers adopt the solution or integrate it with their existing tech stack. \n    \n      \n    \n\n4 Popular B2B SaaS Sales Models for SaaS Companies\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n![Sales Model](https://www.artisan.co/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.ctfassets.net%2Fkyprwggh4muz%2F1KMTpFLIQ6cWKsVcIVHDXB%2F41944bf934620edd9981fe44fb47071f%2FSales_Model.webp&w=3840&q=75)\n\nSome of the steps previously covered in the sales process are true for both SaaS and traditional tech companies. However, several models you can build into a more extensive sales pipeline can bring you significant success in your target market. \n\n  \n\n### Self-Serve Model\n\nThis approach allows potential customers to sign up for your SaaS product without directly interacting with your sales team. On the surface, giving them a way to avoid the sales team seems like a bad idea, but it reduces the friction leads might feel when they wish to learn about a product. This can make trying and purchasing easy–just provide that, and it will lead to some easy-to-understand pricing models and let them create their accounts. \n\n  \n\nThis approach typically includes a freemium model, with a free-to-use tier with limited functionality leading into higher Premium, Business, or Enterprise tiers. \n\n  \n\n**Examples**: Dropbox, Slack\n\n  \n\n### Freemium Model with Upsell\n\nA version of the self-service model, offering a freemium with an upsell, allows users to interact with the product but adds urgency to the upsell. This urgency can come from a time-limited access window to limited feature sets. \n\n  \n\nThe upsell will often come from the time or need urgency (sign up for full access) and can include email nurture campaigns and in-app alerts. \n\n  \n\n**Examples**: Zoom, Mailchimp, LinkedIn  \n\n  \n\n### Usage-Based Model\n\nSome cloud tools track resources with a metered approach. Users can take advantage of some or all of a SaaS solution’s features and pay as they use bandwidth or storage. This can be a great sales incentive for organizations that want to use or build SaaS tools in a cloud infrastructure environment. \n\n  \n\n**Examples**: Amazon Web Services (AWS), Digital Ocean \n\n  \n\n### Enterprise Sales Model\n\nWe’ve previously given examples of relatively simple SaaS products. The model gets slightly more complex regarding more advanced enterprise SaaS platforms with dozens or hundreds of features. The enterprise model focuses on selling large-scale cloud solutions that involve several layers of proposals, approvals, and customer touchpoints. \n\n  \n\nThis model calls for account representatives with a deep knowledge of their target industry. It may involve several sales process stages, including additional presentations, demonstrations, sample projects, and negotiations. \n\n  \n\n**Examples**: Workday, SAP, Salesforce\n\n  \n\nB2B SaaS Sales Strategy for Success\n-----------------------------------\n\nA B2B sales strategy will depend on how your sales team articulates the value of your SaaS product to decision-makers throughout the process. \n\n  \n\n### Craft a Compelling Value Proposition\n\n![Craft a Compelling Value Proposition](https://www.artisan.co/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.ctfassets.net%2Fkyprwggh4muz%2F2eHGnL0G9UWnNHfcGh2Ubm%2Fec4c16724968e7087ac653a6bc409b5c%2FCraft_a_Compelling_Value_Proposition.webp&w=3840&q=75)\n\nUnderstanding and articulating your value proposition is the key to any successful sales approach. The value proposition tells the customer what you can give them and how it can solve their specific problems.\n\n  \n\nA good value proposition should include a list of key features and an apparent narrative explaining how those features benefit the customer. \n\n  \n\nAdditionally, your Unique Selling Points (USPs) are just as important as the value proposition. These are how you differentiate your SaaS product from competitors and provide proof of success. For example, you might provide customers with a comparison table highlighting key features against competitors or use customer stories to show leads that the product fits specific niches and use cases.  \n\n  \n\nFinally, use automated personalized outreach via AI SDRs like [Ava](https://www.artisan.co/ai-sales-agent)\n to bring data to your messaging and help you craft a compelling value proposition. \n\n  \n\n**Artisan's AI SDR Ava automates your outbound lead generation, bringing hot leads to your inbox on autopilot.** [Try Ava now](https://www.artisan.co/ai-sales-agent)\n.\n\n  \n\n### Demonstrate Value Throughout the SaaS Sales Cycle\n\nThe sales cycle should include a consistent and ongoing reaffirmation of your product's value. This affirmation should include a broad set of examples of how your product addresses specific needs and pain points. \n\n  \n\nSome common ways to accomplish this include:\n\n  \n\n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Demos**. Targeted, strategic demonstrations of product features can be critical throughout the process. By both providing generalized demonstrations and setting up feature- and industry-specific demos, you can ensure that any stakeholder who needs a reminder of your value has the chance to get one.\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Case Studies**. Case studies provide critical narratives about your product to your potential leads. These studies show buyers can trust your SaaS solution to fit their needs. Create downloadable PDFs and include them on your website and as part of any email nurture campaigns.\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Customer Stories**. Customer stories are often less formal than case studies but can provide key social proof that your product solves real problems in real-life situations. Downloadable one-sheet stories can be an easy way to distribute these materials, and video testimonials can add that critical human touch.\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Free Trials**. Offering a free trial or freemium version of your product lets customers see the value of your product themselves. It also gives your salespeople a “hands-free” way to engage while they focus on follow-ups or upselling.\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **The Proposal.** The proposal gives you space to demonstrate value through some of the techniques we’ve discussed. By including testimonials, customer stories, and use cases alongside demos, you can provide a package that keeps the value of your product front and center, even in the later stages of the sales pipeline.\n    \n      \n    \n\n### Track and Analyze Key Metrics for SaaS Business\n\n![Track](https://www.artisan.co/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.ctfassets.net%2Fkyprwggh4muz%2F2DfY5pMNZajHbcnIvH7kwq%2F0b618b3476cd8160adf381324daeae24%2FTrack.webp&w=3840&q=75)\n\nSo, how do you measure success? With traditional software, this poses a more straightforward challenge to sales and revenue. However, with B2B SaaS solutions, these metrics are slightly different. \n\n  \n\n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Conversion rates of leads to customers**. It seems obvious enough, but you must understand how many leads are coming through the pipeline. It also helps to understand the sales cycle length and how long it takes to move a lead from first contact to closing the sale.\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Monthly Recurring Revenue (MRR)** and **Annual Recurring Revenue (ARR)** measure how sales translate to ongoing subscription revenue.\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Customer acquisition costs (CAC)** related to sales efforts can tell you the price tag for each customer exactly. This, in turn, can help you better understand how to optimize costs and measure success as acquisition costs against potential monthly revenue.\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    A high **churn rate** can be a major revenue problem. Churn and **customer** **retention rates** are critical for sales professionals in B2B SaaS because they are responsible for maintaining their customer base and, ideally, upselling them into higher subscription tiers.\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    Combining user revenue with the average customer lifetime allows you to calculate the **Customer Lifetime Value (CLV),** which helps with long-term projections regarding your company’s value.\n    \n      \n    \n\nHow AI Can Optimize Your B2B SaaS Sales\n---------------------------------------\n\nAI is changing the name of the game in most industries, and B2B SaaS sales aren’t any different. New intelligent automation and creative, generative AI are shaping how and with what quality salespeople can engage with leads throughout their pipeline. These impacts include:\n\n  \n\n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    Task automation is based on where a lead is in their journey, any actions they’ve taken, or demographic information.\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    More effective lead generation and qualification leveraging AI-driven insights.\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    Creative input on messaging, email nurturing, and personalized engagement with generative AI.\n    \n      \n    \n\n![Ava](https://www.artisan.co/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.ctfassets.net%2Fkyprwggh4muz%2Fd1jgVVeb94NYYlelYRFrY%2F1812c1fd74cba446e9c4ddc111b703c2%2FAva.webp&w=3840&q=75)\n\nAI integration in SaaS sales goes beyond automation. It's reshaping lead scoring, personalizing outreach, and predicting customer behavior. AI SDRs like [Ava](https://www.artisan.co/ai-sales-agent)\n can analyze engagement patterns, suggest optimal messaging, and even conduct initial conversations. This allows sales teams to focus on high-value interactions and complex deal-closing activities.\n\n  \n\nThe future of B2B SaaS sales lies in adaptability. As markets evolve, successful teams will blend traditional sales skills with data-driven insights and AI-powered tools. They'll need to stay agile, continuously refine their strategies, and focus on delivering measurable value to customers. By embracing these changes, SaaS companies can build more efficient, effective sales processes that drive sustainable growth in an increasingly competitive landscape.\n\n  \n\n**Streamline your B2B SaaS pipeline with an AI BDR, that automates your outbound lead generation.** [Learn what Ava can do.](https://www.artisan.co/ai-sales-agent)\n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\nShare Article\n\n![copy-link](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/copy-link.svg)[![copy-link](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/mail.svg)](mailto:?body=https://www.artisan.co/blog/b2b-saas-sales-model)\n\nYou might also like\n-------------------\n\nReady to Supercharge Your Outbound?\n-----------------------------------\n\nOur AI-first platform equips your team with best-in-class outbound tools and our AI BDR Ava, who automates your entire outbound workflow.\n\nPhone\n\nGet Started\n\n### Products\n\n*   [Artisan Sales Overview](/sales-ai)\n    \n*   [Ava, the AI Sales Agent](/ai-sales-agent)\n    \n*   [B2B Data](/products/b2b-data)\n    \n*   [Sales Playbooks](/products/sales-playbooks)\n    \n*   [Email Warmup](/products/email-warmup)\n    \n*   [Sales Automation](/products/sales-automation)\n    \n\n### Resources\n\n*   [Blog](/blog)\n    \n*   [Demos](/watch-demo)\n    \n*   [Support](https://support.artisan.co/)\n    \n*   [Case Studies](/casestudies)\n    \n*   ChangelogSoon\n    \n\n### Solutions\n\n*   [Enterprise](/solutions/enterprise)\n    \n*   [Midmarket](/solutions/midmarket)\n    \n*   [Startups](/solutions/startups)\n    \n*   Lead Gen AgenciesSoon\n    \n\n### Company\n\n*   [About Us](/about)\n    \n*   [Contact Us](/contact-us)\n    \n*   [Careers](/careers)\n    \n*   Artisan LabsSoon\n    \n\n![artisan-logo](https://www.artisan.co/_next/image?url=%2Fassets%2Flogo.webp&w=384&q=75)\n\n© 2024 Artisan AI Inc.

[Dealroom reports](https://dealroom.co/guides/saas)\n that 47% of all venture capital in 2023 was invested in SaaS platforms. \n\n  \n\nThis is because SaaS outsources traditional software's limitations (updating, installation, integration), making adoption more manageable, flexible, and cost-effective. \n\n  \n\nHowever, your sales team might need help mapping a new sales process tied to subscription-based software–help outlining a unique value proposition, tracking metrics, or looking for ways to upsell an existing customer base.\n\n  \n\nThis article discusses the four best sales models for B2B SaaS products and how they can help you pivot your sales know-how into one of the biggest markets in tech.\n\n  \n\nHow Is SaaS Sales Different From Traditional Sales Models?\n----------------------------------------------------------\n\nBusinesses love SaaS tools because they are easy. Do you want to stay flexible? Cloud tools can help. Want to get an entire team onboarded quickly? SaaS solutions make it easy. Need to get away from downloadables, updates, and patches? SaaS is the way. \n\n  \n\nThese reasons are probably why [99% of companies will use at least one SaaS solution by the end of 2024](https://www.saasacademy.com/blog/saas-statistics)\n. \n\n  \n\nHow does SaaS make all of this possible?\n\n  \n\n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **They are a move to subscription-based purchases** rather than one-time purchases. Rather than licensing and downloads, SaaS solutions rely on monthly or annual payments, providing more opportunities to upgrade or upsell paying customers.\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **SaaS deployment provides always-on web services via a web browser**. This makes software much more accessible (everyone has a web browser) and minimizes the need for users to update or upgrade software constantly.\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    SaaS includes a maintenance model that **outsources critical functions like updates, upgrades, or security and compliance issues to the software provider**. \n    \n      \n    \n\n  \n\nAnd when the technology changes, sales will follow. Instead of focusing on a one-time transactional sales model, your sales team will look at a shorter sales cycle and a revenue model reflecting earnings over time rather than at the point of sale.  \n\n  \n\nAdditionally, new features can translate into new subscription tiers, providing sales teams plenty of opportunities to upsell existing customers.  \n\n  \n\n### B2B vs. B2C SaaS Sales\n\nB2B SaaS sales will focus on account-based relationships. Instead of seeking mass licenses from a wide range of customers, you’ll look to sell ongoing packages of services and software that fulfill daily enterprise needs. \n\n  \n\nIt’s not just about enterprise users, however. Many small- and mid-sized businesses (SMBs) need comprehensive packages with the flexibility to adjust pricing tiers and features monthly or annually.   \n\n  \n\nThe SaaS Sales Process\n----------------------\n\n![Pipeline](https://www.artisan.co/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.ctfassets.net%2Fkyprwggh4muz%2F6D8Y5RbowveVVzmPpqp4Y7%2F319e6f7f702b73a688330c827f8ae416%2FPipeline.webp&w=3840&q=75)\n\nThere are hundreds of SaaS solutions available for both general consumers and business customers… This market grew to the tune of $101.47B in 2023 and is expected to top [$400B in the next decade](https://www.precedenceresearch.com/software-as-a-service-market#:~:text=The%20U.S.%20software%20as%20a,13.5%25%20from%202024%20to%202034.)\n. That means that there is plenty of room to stake your claim with the right features. \n\n  \n\nThe B2B SaaS sales process is similar to a traditional sales pipeline, albeit considering the unique contours of a SaaS product. \n\n  \n\n### Stage 1: Lead Generation\n\nLead generation (or lead gen) is critical to the B2B SaaS sales process and extends across several contexts and situations. The full scope of lead gen can include:\n\n  \n\n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Inbound marketing,** covering targeted SaaS marketing, SEO content development, webinars, and other indirect approaches that raise your product or brand profile.\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Outbound prospecting** usually includes email campaigns, social media outreach, and participation in SaaS industry events to connect with potential customers and nurture them through a CRM or Artisan's [AI SDR Ava](https://www.artisan.co/ai-sales-agent)\n    .\n    \n      \n    \n\n![Lead Generation](https://www.artisan.co/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.ctfassets.net%2Fkyprwggh4muz%2F6CAtUvP4E7z6TmLoVjAnU3%2F2dd308a33d0615b4323f72163756170c%2FLead_Generation.webp&w=3840&q=75)\n\nIn either case, lead generation efforts should align with your existing Ideal Customer Profile (ICP), which should model new customers and those likely to stay with a product for a long-term commitment.   \n\n  \n\n### Stage 2: Lead Qualification\n\nLead qualification is a foundational part of any sales pipeline. Potential leads should be scored and ranked based on their alignment with your ICP and organizational goals, with metrics including behavioral traits, financial or professional situations, or demographics. \n\n  \n\nOne criteria to use in qualifying leads is the Budget, Authority, Need, and Timeline (BANT) approach:\n\n  \n\n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Budget**: What is the customer’s budget for a SaaS solution? Is it readily available, and are there any financial constraints?\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Authority**: Are you engaging with someone who can make purchasing decisions? Are there one or multiple stakeholders in the decision-making process?\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Need**: What needs does your SaaS solution meet for the customer, and how critical is adoption in terms of time or costs?\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Timeline**: When will the customer be ready to make a purchase? How long do they have for implementation?\n    \n      \n    \n\n### Stage 3: Product Demonstration\n\nProduct demos are among the most valuable and practical sales tools available. [The SaaStr community](https://www.saastr.com/what-is-a-good-demo-conversion-rate-for-saas-startup/#:~:text=10%25%2D20%25.,%2D15%20is%20pretty%20common).)\n reports that the average conversion rate for a product demo is up to 20%—not too bad for a single asset. \n\n  \n\nHowever, not all product demos are created equal. A generic demo can bounce a potential lead faster than anything else. Make sure to customize demos to speak directly to important features to customers (or customer segments). Think interactivity and hands-on demonstrations that show rather than tell. \n\n  \n\nAnswer questions about how your product:\n\n  \n\n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    Simplifies or streamlines everyday tasks for the customer. \n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    Increases productivity through automation or customization.\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    Reduces costs by providing better functionality than their existing solution at a lower price point. \n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    Eases use through onboarding and white-glove support. \n    \n      \n    \n\n  \n\nOften, a demo can include a free or “freemium” version of your SaaS solution that a lead can use on their own time and terms. \n\n  \n\n### Stage 4: Proposal and Negotiation\n\nWhile submitting a proposal might seem like the final step of the sales process, it is better to see this as the first step in negotiations. \n\n  \n\nAny reasonable proposal should include some standard information, including:\n\n  \n\n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **An outline of the terms of the relationship** and the features and capabilities you are delivering to solve specific problems.\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Deliverables** like access to the product, any white-glove customer support services, credits, and so on.\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **A timeline for these deliverables**, including immediate next steps.\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Pricing, payment terms, and deadlines.**\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Case studies and testimonials** that demonstrate costs, ROI, etc.\n    \n      \n    \n\n  \n\nOnce the proposal has been submitted, internal stakeholders will likely have questions about the SaaS solution, such as prices, availability, usefulness, etc. These buyers are making a long-term commitment, and you should be ready and patient with these questions. \n\n  \n\n### Stage 5: Closing Deals\n\nThe proposal has been submitted, questions answered, and now both parties have reached what seems like a deal–if you can close it. \n\n  \n\nYou want to “seal the deal” with an agreement at this stage. Everything, including contracts or paperwork, should be worked out. Many modern companies use digital solutions like DocuSign or Dropbox to allow customers to sign documents automatically. \n\n  \n\nFree or freemium access to your software can create real urgency for your lead to close. If they like it, losing access (or even having limited access) can light a fire under them to close the deal and get their team on the platform.\n\n  \n\nStage 6: Onboarding and Implementation\n--------------------------------------\n\nFinally, once the customer is signed on, provide ongoing support. This should include:\n\n  \n\n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    Training resources and an easily accessible knowledge base.\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    On-call support from your customer service staff. \n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    A dedicated contact point for your customers to ensure they can get problems addressed quickly.\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    IT support to help customers adopt the solution or integrate it with their existing tech stack. \n    \n      \n    \n\n4 Popular B2B SaaS Sales Models for SaaS Companies\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n![Sales Model](https://www.artisan.co/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.ctfassets.net%2Fkyprwggh4muz%2F1KMTpFLIQ6cWKsVcIVHDXB%2F41944bf934620edd9981fe44fb47071f%2FSales_Model.webp&w=3840&q=75)\n\nSome of the steps previously covered in the sales process are true for both SaaS and traditional tech companies. However, several models you can build into a more extensive sales pipeline can bring you significant success in your target market. \n\n  \n\n### Self-Serve Model\n\nThis approach allows potential customers to sign up for your SaaS product without directly interacting with your sales team. On the surface, giving them a way to avoid the sales team seems like a bad idea, but it reduces the friction leads might feel when they wish to learn about a product. This can make trying and purchasing easy–just provide that, and it will lead to some easy-to-understand pricing models and let them create their accounts. \n\n  \n\nThis approach typically includes a freemium model, with a free-to-use tier with limited functionality leading into higher Premium, Business, or Enterprise tiers. \n\n  \n\n**Examples**: Dropbox, Slack\n\n  \n\n### Freemium Model with Upsell\n\nA version of the self-service model, offering a freemium with an upsell, allows users to interact with the product but adds urgency to the upsell. This urgency can come from a time-limited access window to limited feature sets. \n\n  \n\nThe upsell will often come from the time or need urgency (sign up for full access) and can include email nurture campaigns and in-app alerts. \n\n  \n\n**Examples**: Zoom, Mailchimp, LinkedIn  \n\n  \n\n### Usage-Based Model\n\nSome cloud tools track resources with a metered approach. Users can take advantage of some or all of a SaaS solution’s features and pay as they use bandwidth or storage. This can be a great sales incentive for organizations that want to use or build SaaS tools in a cloud infrastructure environment. \n\n  \n\n**Examples**: Amazon Web Services (AWS), Digital Ocean \n\n  \n\n### Enterprise Sales Model\n\nWe’ve previously given examples of relatively simple SaaS products. The model gets slightly more complex regarding more advanced enterprise SaaS platforms with dozens or hundreds of features. The enterprise model focuses on selling large-scale cloud solutions that involve several layers of proposals, approvals, and customer touchpoints. \n\n  \n\nThis model calls for account representatives with a deep knowledge of their target industry. It may involve several sales process stages, including additional presentations, demonstrations, sample projects, and negotiations. \n\n  \n\n**Examples**: Workday, SAP, Salesforce\n\n  \n\nB2B SaaS Sales Strategy for Success\n-----------------------------------\n\nA B2B sales strategy will depend on how your sales team articulates the value of your SaaS product to decision-makers throughout the process. \n\n  \n\n### Craft a Compelling Value Proposition\n\n![Craft a Compelling Value Proposition](https://www.artisan.co/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.ctfassets.net%2Fkyprwggh4muz%2F2eHGnL0G9UWnNHfcGh2Ubm%2Fec4c16724968e7087ac653a6bc409b5c%2FCraft_a_Compelling_Value_Proposition.webp&w=3840&q=75)\n\nUnderstanding and articulating your value proposition is the key to any successful sales approach. The value proposition tells the customer what you can give them and how it can solve their specific problems.\n\n  \n\nA good value proposition should include a list of key features and an apparent narrative explaining how those features benefit the customer. \n\n  \n\nAdditionally, your Unique Selling Points (USPs) are just as important as the value proposition. These are how you differentiate your SaaS product from competitors and provide proof of success. For example, you might provide customers with a comparison table highlighting key features against competitors or use customer stories to show leads that the product fits specific niches and use cases.  \n\n  \n\nFinally, use automated personalized outreach via AI SDRs like [Ava](https://www.artisan.co/ai-sales-agent)\n to bring data to your messaging and help you craft a compelling value proposition. \n\n  \n\n**Artisan's AI SDR Ava automates your outbound lead generation, bringing hot leads to your inbox on autopilot.** [Try Ava now](https://www.artisan.co/ai-sales-agent)\n.\n\n  \n\n### Demonstrate Value Throughout the SaaS Sales Cycle\n\nThe sales cycle should include a consistent and ongoing reaffirmation of your product's value. This affirmation should include a broad set of examples of how your product addresses specific needs and pain points. \n\n  \n\nSome common ways to accomplish this include:\n\n  \n\n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Demos**. Targeted, strategic demonstrations of product features can be critical throughout the process. By both providing generalized demonstrations and setting up feature- and industry-specific demos, you can ensure that any stakeholder who needs a reminder of your value has the chance to get one.\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Case Studies**. Case studies provide critical narratives about your product to your potential leads. These studies show buyers can trust your SaaS solution to fit their needs. Create downloadable PDFs and include them on your website and as part of any email nurture campaigns.\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Customer Stories**. Customer stories are often less formal than case studies but can provide key social proof that your product solves real problems in real-life situations. Downloadable one-sheet stories can be an easy way to distribute these materials, and video testimonials can add that critical human touch.\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Free Trials**. Offering a free trial or freemium version of your product lets customers see the value of your product themselves. It also gives your salespeople a “hands-free” way to engage while they focus on follow-ups or upselling.\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **The Proposal.** The proposal gives you space to demonstrate value through some of the techniques we’ve discussed. By including testimonials, customer stories, and use cases alongside demos, you can provide a package that keeps the value of your product front and center, even in the later stages of the sales pipeline.\n    \n      \n    \n\n### Track and Analyze Key Metrics for SaaS Business\n\n![Track](https://www.artisan.co/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.ctfassets.net%2Fkyprwggh4muz%2F2DfY5pMNZajHbcnIvH7kwq%2F0b618b3476cd8160adf381324daeae24%2FTrack.webp&w=3840&q=75)\n\nSo, how do you measure success? With traditional software, this poses a more straightforward challenge to sales and revenue. However, with B2B SaaS solutions, these metrics are slightly different. \n\n  \n\n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Conversion rates of leads to customers**. It seems obvious enough, but you must understand how many leads are coming through the pipeline. It also helps to understand the sales cycle length and how long it takes to move a lead from first contact to closing the sale.\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Monthly Recurring Revenue (MRR)** and **Annual Recurring Revenue (ARR)** measure how sales translate to ongoing subscription revenue.\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Customer acquisition costs (CAC)** related to sales efforts can tell you the price tag for each customer exactly. This, in turn, can help you better understand how to optimize costs and measure success as acquisition costs against potential monthly revenue.\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    A high **churn rate** can be a major revenue problem. Churn and **customer** **retention rates** are critical for sales professionals in B2B SaaS because they are responsible for maintaining their customer base and, ideally, upselling them into higher subscription tiers.\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    Combining user revenue with the average customer lifetime allows you to calculate the **Customer Lifetime Value (CLV),** which helps with long-term projections regarding your company’s value.\n    \n      \n    \n\nHow AI Can Optimize Your B2B SaaS Sales\n---------------------------------------\n\nAI is changing the name of the game in most industries, and B2B SaaS sales aren’t any different. New intelligent automation and creative, generative AI are shaping how and with what quality salespeople can engage with leads throughout their pipeline. These impacts include:\n\n  \n\n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    Task automation is based on where a lead is in their journey, any actions they’ve taken, or demographic information.\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    More effective lead generation and qualification leveraging AI-driven insights.\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    Creative input on messaging, email nurturing, and personalized engagement with generative AI.\n    \n      \n    \n\n![Ava](https://www.artisan.co/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.ctfassets.net%2Fkyprwggh4muz%2Fd1jgVVeb94NYYlelYRFrY%2F1812c1fd74cba446e9c4ddc111b703c2%2FAva.webp&w=3840&q=75)\n\nAI integration in SaaS sales goes beyond automation. It's reshaping lead scoring, personalizing outreach, and predicting customer behavior. AI SDRs like [Ava](https://www.artisan.co/ai-sales-agent)\n can analyze engagement patterns, suggest optimal messaging, and even conduct initial conversations. This allows sales teams to focus on high-value interactions and complex deal-closing activities.\n\n  \n\nThe future of B2B SaaS sales lies in adaptability. As markets evolve, successful teams will blend traditional sales skills with data-driven insights and AI-powered tools. They'll need to stay agile, continuously refine their strategies, and focus on delivering measurable value to customers. By embracing these changes, SaaS companies can build more efficient, effective sales processes that drive sustainable growth in an increasingly competitive landscape.\n\n  \n\n**Streamline your B2B SaaS pipeline with an AI BDR, that automates your outbound lead generation.** [Learn what Ava can do.](https://www.artisan.co/ai-sales-agent)\n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\nShare Article\n\n![copy-link](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/copy-link.svg)[![copy-link](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/mail.svg)](mailto:?body=https://www.artisan.co/blog/b2b-saas-sales-model)\n\nYou might also like\n-------------------\n\nReady to Supercharge Your Outbound?\n-----------------------------------\n\nOur AI-first platform equips your team with best-in-class outbound tools and our AI BDR Ava, who automates your entire outbound workflow.\n\nPhone\n\nGet Started\n\n### Products\n\n*   [Artisan Sales Overview](/sales-ai)\n    \n*   [Ava, the AI Sales Agent](/ai-sales-agent)\n    \n*   [B2B Data](/products/b2b-data)\n    \n*   [Sales Playbooks](/products/sales-playbooks)\n    \n*   [Email Warmup](/products/email-warmup)\n    \n*   [Sales Automation](/products/sales-automation)\n    \n\n### Resources\n\n*   [Blog](/blog)\n    \n*   [Demos](/watch-demo)\n    \n*   [Support](https://support.artisan.co/)\n    \n*   [Case Studies](/casestudies)\n    \n*   ChangelogSoon\n    \n\n### Solutions\n\n*   [Enterprise](/solutions/enterprise)\n    \n*   [Midmarket](/solutions/midmarket)\n    \n*   [Startups](/solutions/startups)\n    \n*   Lead Gen AgenciesSoon\n    \n\n### Company\n\n*   [About Us](/about)\n    \n*   [Contact Us](/contact-us)\n    \n*   [Careers](/careers)\n    \n*   Artisan LabsSoon\n    \n\n![artisan-logo](https://www.artisan.co/_next/image?url=%2Fassets%2Flogo.webp&w=384&q=75)\n\n© 2024 Artisan AI Inc.

For many marketers and salespeople, those three little letters are an ill omen. \n\n  \n\nSales KPIs _are_ important. But only when they truly help drive revenue. You’re already gasping for air in a rising tide of data. And you’re not going to hit your growth and revenue goals with unnecessary additions to your crowded analytics dashboard. \n\n  \n\nWe get it. That’s why we’ve got a zero-tolerance approach to vanity metrics that exist solely to fill out largely meaningless performance reports.  \n\n  \n\nWe’ll cover KPIs that actually generate sales growth and align with your business goals. Crucially, we’ll explain why they’re important and how they can help you and your team make better decisions. \n\n  \n\nLet’s get to it. \n\n  \n\nWhy B2B Sales KPIs Matter\n-------------------------\n\nKey performance indicators are important because they set your company’s direction for growth. They’re the bedrock on which you define goals, measure progress, align your team's strategic activities, and make critical business decisions. \n\n  \n\nKPIs are not performance _targets_ themselves. Rather, they’re the metrics used to label your targets and measure progress towards them. The target is the specific goal you're aiming for while the associated KPI tells you if you’re on track to achieve it. \n\n  \n\nFor example, you set a target of achieving a 20% lead-to-customer conversion rate by the end of Q4. In this case, 20% by the end of Q4 is the target while lead-to-customer conversions is the KPI. \n\n  \n![Target](https://www.artisan.co/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.ctfassets.net%2Fkyprwggh4muz%2F1DQlFb8TbPjk8QdKvacZe9%2F3b70f562839a73f95da77f9a0168a369%2FTarget.webp&w=3840&q=75)\n\nYou might be wondering what the difference between KPIs and other metrics is. The clue is in the word “key.” KPIs are metrics considered fundamental to the success and high-level goals of your business. \n\n  \n\nMany other metrics focus on tactical and operational processes. For example, your website bounce rate or email open rate are both important metrics, but they’re not key indicators of your company’s overall health. \n\n  \n\nTracking KPIs gives you a basis for identifying strengths and weaknesses in your strategic approach to growth and determining whether or not your goals are realistic. You can use this understanding to make data-backed decisions likely to lead to improvements. \n\n  \n\nIn addition, sales KPIs are incredibly useful for fostering accountability and motivation in your sales team. Nothing energizes a sales time like KPIs on track to meet targets. Equally, subpar performance creates a clear context for identifying areas of weakness and inefficiency.  \n\n  \n\n12 Important B2B Sales KPIs to Track \n-------------------------------------\n\n![Track](https://www.artisan.co/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.ctfassets.net%2Fkyprwggh4muz%2F2DfY5pMNZajHbcnIvH7kwq%2F0b618b3476cd8160adf381324daeae24%2FTrack.webp&w=3840&q=75)\n\n### 1\\. Sales Activity and Outreach \n\n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Definition:** Activity KPIs measure the number of actions a sales team makes in a particular area, such as volume of cold calls dialed or email follow-ups sent. They contrast with sales performance metrics because they do not track specific outcomes. \n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Why it matters:** While sales activity and outreach KPIs don’t measure performance directly, they’re still important because they indicate the overall efficiency of a sales team and act as a basis for setting realistic performance goals. When you know how many actions your sales team is completing, you can better determine appropriate outcomes. “Increase cold sales calls in America and Canada by 20% over 12 months” is an example of a goal based on an activity KPI. \n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Examples:** Cold emails sent, calls dialed, demos given, meetings booked, and proposals generated. \n    \n      \n    \n\nMeasuring sales activities can quickly become confusing. One way of staying organized is to use an AI sales development representative (SDR) to ensure all activity is logged and available in a single place. \n\n  \n\n**Artisan has an AI SDR called Ava, and she can track all sales activity within the platform.** [Get in touch today](https://www.artisan.co/talk-to-sales?page_source=/pricing)\n to see how Ava can help you track all your key sales activities with practically no manual input. \n\n  \n\n### 2\\. Sales-Qualified Leads by Source \n\n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Definition:** Sales-qualified leads by source measures the volume of interested leads that come from specific sales and marketing channels. \n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Why it matters:** Tracking new sales-qualified leads by source tells you which of your marketing channels is most effective at generating high-quality leads. Some channels will provide large volumes of low-quality leads while others will generate low volumes of high-quality leads. By measuring sales-qualified leads—leads who have moved some way down your sales funnel and are likely to buy—you can identify those channels that effectively drive _both_ quantity and quality and leverage them further. \n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Examples:** Track the volume of sales-qualified leads by source across _all_ your channels: email marketing, social media, search engine traffic, paid online and offline advertising, referrals, affiliate marketing, events and joint ventures. \n    \n      \n    \n\n### 3\\. Average Lead Response Time (Speed to Lead)\n\n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Definition:** Your average lead response time (also called speed to lead) measures the average time it takes you to respond to a lead once they’ve contacted your company (by filling out a web form or ending an enquiry email, for example). \n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Why it matters:** The faster you can reach out to leads, the more likely they are to convert. [Forbes](https://www.forbes.com/sites/theyec/2019/09/10/step-by-step-guide-to-following-up-with-b2b-leads-generated-by-sdrs/?sh=45eb93cf2309)\n     reports that you’re 100 times more likely to successfully contact a lead if you follow up in under five minutes. If you can reduce your average lead response time, you’ll see gains across other baseline KPIs like sales and revenue.\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Formula:** Average lead response time = Total time taken to respond to leads / Number of leads\n    \n      \n    \n\n![1. Avg Lead Response Time](https://www.artisan.co/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.ctfassets.net%2Fkyprwggh4muz%2F2ny0GS81Sn2mQIgRQFeMUp%2Fb9fcc458da3614eae3879439277ba9df%2F1._Avg_Lead_Response_Time.webp&w=3840&q=75)\n\n### 4\\. Marketing Qualified Leads (MQL) to Sales Qualified Leads (SQL) Conversion Rate\n\n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Definition:** Your MQL-to-SQL rate measures the percentage of leads transitioning from marketing-qualified leads to sales-qualified leads. \n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Why it matters:** Sales teams use different lead-scoring methods to define MQLs and SQLs. However, in all cases the distinction points to levels of interest. An MQL has shown enough interest in your company to be considered likely to buy. An SQL has moved through part of your sales funnel and is considered _highly_ likely to buy. Your MQL-to-SQL strategy indicates the efficacy of your lead nurturing process. A low percentage may point to the fact that your sales team is not engaging adequately with leads generated and their approach needs improving. \n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Formula:** Marketing-qualified leads (MQL) to sales-qualified leads (SQL) conversion rate = (Total Number of SQLs / Total number of MQLs) x 100\n    \n      \n    \n\n![2. MQL to SQL](https://www.artisan.co/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.ctfassets.net%2Fkyprwggh4muz%2F5B9tfdgD7VXiawbI8r8iI4%2Fbc96ed083cb5651064b501a030b987fc%2F2._MQL_to_SQL.webp&w=3840&q=75)\n\n### 5\\. Qualified Lead to Customer Conversion Rate (Sales Close Rate)\n\n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Definition:** Your lead to customer conversion rate measures how many of your qualified leads are converting to customers. Unlike your MQL-to-SQL rate, it tracks the performance of your whole sales funnel, from early stage marketing to the moment a lead signs on the dotted line (or hits that “Pay Now” button). \n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Why it matters:** Your lead to customer conversion rate measures the success of your sales funnel at a very high level. Unlike more specific KPIs that measure individual stages of your funnel, your lead conversion rate gives an overall indicator of the health of your “engine.” Boosting your lead conversion rate will directly impact your revenue and profitability. Qualified leads in this sense encompass both marketing and sales qualified leads. \n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Formula:** Lead conversion rate = (Number of new customers / Number of qualified leads) x 100\n    \n      \n    \n\n![3. Lead Conversion Rate](https://www.artisan.co/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.ctfassets.net%2Fkyprwggh4muz%2F4lCgOC755uq4Oc0ElJr8rE%2F8d62a7b8b6e022c2e778c57074b53eb1%2F3._Lead_Conversion_Rate.webp&w=3840&q=75)\n\nOne of the best ways of increasing your lead conversion rate is to use detailed ideal customer profiles (ICPs) based on up-to-date data. \n\n  \n\n**Artisan’s AI SDR Ava has a database of over 300 million potential leads from which she can target your ICP, all on autopilot.** [Get in touch now](https://www.artisan.co/talk-to-sales?page_source=/pricing)\n to see how Artisan can help you meet your sales targets. \n\n  \n\n### 6\\. Sales Win Rate (Closed-Won Opportunities) \n\n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Definition:** Your sales win rate measures your closed won opportunities against all closed opportunities (closed won opportunities and closed opportunities that didn’t result in a sale). \n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Why it matters:** Your sales win rate shows you how many leads have converted to customers out of all leads who have _completed the sales cycle_. Closed-lost leads have given a definite “no” to your offer or been deemed inactive. This KPI is different to your lead to customer conversion rate or sales close rate because it illustrates how well your sales team is converting leads they’ve actively engaged with into customers. A poor month-by-month lead to customer conversion rate and a high sales win rate may indicate that your sales team is struggling to connect with all leads and many are remaining as open opportunities. \n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Formula:** Win rate = (Closed-won leads / (Closed-won leads + closed-lost leads)) x 100\n    \n      \n    \n\n![4. Sales Win Rate](https://www.artisan.co/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.ctfassets.net%2Fkyprwggh4muz%2F5sn3knoD1MQZomvUnRuCah%2Fcf4ad3a576905c99fb6ec2092cef2e0a%2F4._Sales_Win_Rate.webp&w=3840&q=75)\n\n### 7\\. Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC) \n\n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Definition:** Your customer acquisition cost tells you how much it costs to gain a new customer. \n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Why it matters:** Reducing your customer acquisition cost increases revenue. If the cost of acquiring a customer is reducing over time, it indicates that your marketing and sales team are becoming more efficient, either because of streamlined processes, more effective sales techniques, or the identification of appropriate marketing channels. \n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Formula:** Customer acquisition cost = Total expenditure on sales and marketing / Number of new customers\n    \n      \n    \n\n![5. CAC](https://www.artisan.co/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.ctfassets.net%2Fkyprwggh4muz%2F7nP2DPIEBEclQ4j6het2xG%2Fcf7e9e16767b8fffffcc8cef00010960%2F5._CAC.webp&w=3840&q=75)\n\n### 8\\. Pipeline Velocity\n\n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Definition:** Your pipeline velocity, also called sales velocity, measures the speed at which sales-qualified leads become customers. It’s calculated as revenue per quarter—for example, $100,000/quarter, which represents $100,000 in closed deals over a quarter. \n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Why it matters:** Pipeline velocity measures the efficiency of your later-stage sales funnel and allows you to make revenue forecasts. A low Pipeline velocity may suggest that your sales team is experiencing operational difficulties or their sales techniques could be improved. A higher pipeline velocity means a better return on investment (ROI) for your sales budget. \n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Formula:** Pipeline velocity = (Number of sales-qualified leads x average deal value x win rate) / (Length of sales cycle / 91 (days in a business quarter))\n    \n      \n    \n\n![6. Pipeline Velocity](https://www.artisan.co/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.ctfassets.net%2Fkyprwggh4muz%2F18o01nD9NaKNmHV4MpdpEB%2Fe350c9a8f42d4aca4f8f9db32ff66e31%2F6._Pipeline_Velocity.webp&w=3840&q=75)\n\n### 9.  Customer Retention\n\n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Definition:** Your customer retention rate measures the percentage of customers who stay with you over a given period. It’s closely related to churn rate, which measures the number of customers who leave over the same period. \n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Why it matters:** Your ability to hold onto customers directly impacts your revenue. It costs [four to five times as much](https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbesbusinesscouncil/2022/12/12/customer-retention-versus-customer-acquisition/)\n     to acquire a new customer than retain an existing one. In essence, a high customer retention rate means that your customers are happy and you are effectively building loyalty and long-term satisfaction. This also creates upsell and cross-selling opportunities for you. \n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Formula:** Customer retention rate = (Number customers at end of period - number of customers acquired during period) / Number of customers at start of period\n    \n      \n    \n\n![7. Customer Retention Rate](https://www.artisan.co/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.ctfassets.net%2Fkyprwggh4muz%2F2BP4iVshPsYx35DQy4lvGW%2Febecdb4db15505f7ea6cbf9650a63f2c%2F7._Customer_Retention_Rate.webp&w=3840&q=75)\n\n### 10\\. Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) \n\n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Definition:** Customer lifetime value measures the amount of money a customer will spend with you over their lifetime. This can be quite a tricky KPI to calculate because you need enough data to accurately determine the average length of time a customer remains active in addition to their order value and purchase frequency. \n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Why it matters:** Customer lifetime value tracks three important sales metrics in combination: the average time a customer remains active, how often they make a purchase, and the average value of the purchases they make. It’s a full snapshot of the value of your typical customer. If it’s increasing, it means that you’re providing value, building strong customer relationships, and driving up your average deal size. \n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Formula:** Customer lifetime value = Average order value x Purchase frequency x Customer Lifetime\n    \n      \n    \n\n![8. Customer lifetime value](https://www.artisan.co/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.ctfassets.net%2Fkyprwggh4muz%2F1Rkg3oFPTb5BHA9Lqrsm9q%2F3f19e889ec233b4be906fc7421529056%2F8._Customer_lifetime_value.webp&w=3840&q=75)\n\n### 11\\. Sales Growth Rate\n\n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Definition:** Your sales growth rate measures the volume of sales in your most recent period compared with the previous period. It’s one of the most important growth metrics for a company. \n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Why it matters:** Your sales growth rate is one of the strongest—if not _the_ strongest—measure of your company’s overall growth. If you’re seeing a steady rise in sales growth, it is likely that your sales team is becoming more efficient, the number of deals is increasing, and marketing efforts are going well.\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Formula:** Sales growth rate = ((Sales in most recent period - Sales in previous period) / Sales in the previous period) x 100\n    \n      \n    \n\n![9. Sales growth rate](https://www.artisan.co/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.ctfassets.net%2Fkyprwggh4muz%2F7pliVcYxbkQ0O4rHqGT9BX%2F82abf18bf2389c39daab3db944ee4e72%2F9.__Sales_growth_rate.webp&w=3840&q=75)\n\n### 12\\. Sales Revenue \n\n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Definition:** Sales revenue is a straightforward KPI that looks at the raw revenue from sales over a given period. \n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Why it matters:** Sales revenue is distinct from turnover. For many companies, sales revenue alone makes up total turnover, but this is not always the case. Where other sources, like investment returns, asset sales, subsidies and so on, contribute to turnover, it’s important to differentiate. Month-on-month or year-on-year sales revenue is a useful KPI for measuring long-term sustainable growth. \n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Formula:** Sales revenue = Number of sales x Average sale value\n    \n      \n    \n\n![10. Sales Revenue](https://www.artisan.co/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.ctfassets.net%2Fkyprwggh4muz%2F274Rcvjd623t7Xf0AARdPf%2Fa97c8b0292c7c9b0e75668529a0b4314%2F10.__Sales_Revenue.webp&w=3840&q=75)\n\nStrategies to Set B2B Sales KPIs for Success \n---------------------------------------------\n\nNow we’ve covered the KPIs, let’s look at how to pick the perfect mix to generate new leads and fill your sales pipeline so it’s overflowing with B2B goodness. \n\n  \n\n### 1\\. Select the Right KPIs \n\n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Align with business goals.** Top-tier sales KPIs should align with executive goals which then “cascade” down your organization in the form of more specific KPIs. For example, you may decide on a high-level company goal to double sales revenue. Sales managers may then use pipeline velocity as the KPI to measure movement towards this goal and individual sales reps may be tracked against outreach activity KPIs. \n    \n      \n    \n\n![Right-KPIs](https://www.artisan.co/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.ctfassets.net%2Fkyprwggh4muz%2F44MLpIC49yZq8l9cNPLhPt%2F6ffbda05ed9c2814ee8cfcad3e7ab59a%2FRight-KPIs.webp&w=3840&q=75)\n\n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Analyze historical data.** Analyzing historical data helps you create forecasts that can act as the basis of realistic goals and relevant KPIs. Historical data can also highlight missed opportunities for immediate results. \n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Prioritize actionable metrics.** Use the SMART framework to pick KPIs and sales metrics that are Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-Bound. \n    \n      \n    \n\n![SMART](https://www.artisan.co/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.ctfassets.net%2Fkyprwggh4muz%2F2KvObMWqTdYV8gbhLMGGZ8%2Fc658e02e3e3b05ad3bafe2be61057391%2FSMART.webp&w=3840&q=75)\n\n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Benchmark against industry standards.** Industry standards are widely available, with reputable sources like Gartner, McKinsey, and Forresster often publishing industry-specific benchmarks. Ultimately, your in-house data should be your main guide, but third-party insights have their place. \n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Consult stakeholders.** Involve all decision-makers across your organization to ensure alignment with high-level KPIs. Consider stakeholder mapping to ensure alignment with company-wide goals and specific metrics. \n    \n      \n    \n\n### 2. Keep it Simple, Clear, and Measurable \n\nChoose KPIs that are relevant to different stages of your sales funnel and well-suited to your existing sales processes. Focus on a core set of sales KPIs that are likely to provide the most valuable insights and help you leverage the most prominent growth opportunities. \n\n  \n\nWherever possible, use automation tools to streamline the collection and analysis of data so that you can measure KPIs in real time in a way that is clear and coherent to the whole sales team. \n\n  \n\n### 3. Track Progress Regularly and Adjust \n\nKPIs are dynamic, fluid metrics. Track progress and make adjustments at both the tactical and strategic level as needed. This ensures your chosen KPIs remain relevant and aligned with broad business goals and that team performance stays at an optimal level.\n\n  \n\nHere are some ideas for adjusting your approach:\n\n  \n\n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    Refine lower-tier metrics  \n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    Update performance benchmarks\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    Explore ways to improve data quality  \n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    Add greater detail to reporting  \n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    Explore possible automations \n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    Gather qualitative feedback feedback  \n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    Adjust timeframes based on sales performance\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    Test and integrate new tools \n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    Realignment incentives where appropriate\n    \n      \n    \n\n  \n\nIn addition, it’s important to ensure that your whole team is involved in the brainstorming process, as they will often have insights into both the best sales opportunities and where sales strategies are experiencing issues and bottlenecks. \n\n  \n\n### 4. Embrace New Technology \n\nStay up-to-date on new data analytics tools and other software to assist with tracking B2B sales KPIs. One of the most straightforward ways of optimizing your team’s sales performance is by using AI-driven automation tools, many of which sync with your main sales CRM.\n\n  \n\n**Boost your sales with Artisan's data-driven outreach optimization.** Our platform analyzes response rates across campaigns, refining your strategy for maximum conversion**.** [Book a demo](https://www.artisan.co/talk-to-sales/)\n to discover how Artisan can help you exceed targets.\n\n  \n\nWrapping It Up: KPIs as Keys to Growth\n--------------------------------------\n\nKPIs are fundamental to your whole business strategy. Pick the wrong ones, and you could be committing to months and even years of subpar growth and internal misalignment.\n\n  \n\nHowever, if you can identify KPIs that fit the broader vision of your company—whether that’s fast growth, a hyper-loyal fanbase, or a dominant presence on your primary sales channels—you’re priming your company for success. \n\n  \n\nEven better, when your chosen KPIs suit the unique strengths of your sales reps, they’re near-guaranteed to boost team performance and drive morale. \n\n  \n\nAdd a layer of automation and AI-driven productivity by taking advantage of the array of powerful tools now at your disposal, and you’ll be hitting those targets faster than you can say “sales.\"\n\n  \n\nShare Article\n\n![copy-link](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/copy-link.svg)[![copy-link](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/mail.svg)](mailto:?body=https://www.artisan.co/blog/b2b-sales-kpis)\n\nYou might also like\n-------------------\n\nReady to Supercharge Your Outbound?\n-----------------------------------\n\nOur AI-first platform equips your team with best-in-class outbound tools and our AI BDR Ava, who automates your entire outbound workflow.\n\nPhone\n\nGet Started\n\n### Products\n\n*   [Artisan Sales Overview](/sales-ai)\n    \n*   [Ava, the AI Sales Agent](/ai-sales-agent)\n    \n*   [B2B Data](/products/b2b-data)\n    \n*   [Sales Playbooks](/products/sales-playbooks)\n    \n*   [Email Warmup](/products/email-warmup)\n    \n*   [Sales Automation](/products/sales-automation)\n    \n\n### Resources\n\n*   [Blog](/blog)\n    \n*   [Demos](/watch-demo)\n    \n*   [Support](https://support.artisan.co/)\n    \n*   [Case Studies](/casestudies)\n    \n*   ChangelogSoon\n    \n\n### Solutions\n\n*   [Enterprise](/solutions/enterprise)\n    \n*   [Midmarket](/solutions/midmarket)\n    \n*   [Startups](/solutions/startups)\n    \n*   Lead Gen AgenciesSoon\n    \n\n### Company\n\n*   [About Us](/about)\n    \n*   [Contact Us](/contact-us)\n    \n*   [Careers](/careers)\n    \n*   Artisan LabsSoon\n    \n\n![artisan-logo](https://www.artisan.co/_next/image?url=%2Fassets%2Flogo.webp&w=384&q=75)\n\n© 2024 Artisan AI Inc.

For many marketers and salespeople, those three little letters are an ill omen. \n\n  \n\nSales KPIs _are_ important. But only when they truly help drive revenue. You’re already gasping for air in a rising tide of data. And you’re not going to hit your growth and revenue goals with unnecessary additions to your crowded analytics dashboard. \n\n  \n\nWe get it. That’s why we’ve got a zero-tolerance approach to vanity metrics that exist solely to fill out largely meaningless performance reports.  \n\n  \n\nWe’ll cover KPIs that actually generate sales growth and align with your business goals. Crucially, we’ll explain why they’re important and how they can help you and your team make better decisions. \n\n  \n\nLet’s get to it. \n\n  \n\nWhy B2B Sales KPIs Matter\n-------------------------\n\nKey performance indicators are important because they set your company’s direction for growth. They’re the bedrock on which you define goals, measure progress, align your team's strategic activities, and make critical business decisions. \n\n  \n\nKPIs are not performance _targets_ themselves. Rather, they’re the metrics used to label your targets and measure progress towards them. The target is the specific goal you're aiming for while the associated KPI tells you if you’re on track to achieve it. \n\n  \n\nFor example, you set a target of achieving a 20% lead-to-customer conversion rate by the end of Q4. In this case, 20% by the end of Q4 is the target while lead-to-customer conversions is the KPI. \n\n  \n![Target](https://www.artisan.co/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.ctfassets.net%2Fkyprwggh4muz%2F1DQlFb8TbPjk8QdKvacZe9%2F3b70f562839a73f95da77f9a0168a369%2FTarget.webp&w=3840&q=75)\n\nYou might be wondering what the difference between KPIs and other metrics is. The clue is in the word “key.” KPIs are metrics considered fundamental to the success and high-level goals of your business. \n\n  \n\nMany other metrics focus on tactical and operational processes. For example, your website bounce rate or email open rate are both important metrics, but they’re not key indicators of your company’s overall health. \n\n  \n\nTracking KPIs gives you a basis for identifying strengths and weaknesses in your strategic approach to growth and determining whether or not your goals are realistic. You can use this understanding to make data-backed decisions likely to lead to improvements. \n\n  \n\nIn addition, sales KPIs are incredibly useful for fostering accountability and motivation in your sales team. Nothing energizes a sales time like KPIs on track to meet targets. Equally, subpar performance creates a clear context for identifying areas of weakness and inefficiency.  \n\n  \n\n12 Important B2B Sales KPIs to Track \n-------------------------------------\n\n![Track](https://www.artisan.co/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.ctfassets.net%2Fkyprwggh4muz%2F2DfY5pMNZajHbcnIvH7kwq%2F0b618b3476cd8160adf381324daeae24%2FTrack.webp&w=3840&q=75)\n\n### 1\\. Sales Activity and Outreach \n\n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Definition:** Activity KPIs measure the number of actions a sales team makes in a particular area, such as volume of cold calls dialed or email follow-ups sent. They contrast with sales performance metrics because they do not track specific outcomes. \n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Why it matters:** While sales activity and outreach KPIs don’t measure performance directly, they’re still important because they indicate the overall efficiency of a sales team and act as a basis for setting realistic performance goals. When you know how many actions your sales team is completing, you can better determine appropriate outcomes. “Increase cold sales calls in America and Canada by 20% over 12 months” is an example of a goal based on an activity KPI. \n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Examples:** Cold emails sent, calls dialed, demos given, meetings booked, and proposals generated. \n    \n      \n    \n\nMeasuring sales activities can quickly become confusing. One way of staying organized is to use an AI sales development representative (SDR) to ensure all activity is logged and available in a single place. \n\n  \n\n**Artisan has an AI SDR called Ava, and she can track all sales activity within the platform.** [Get in touch today](https://www.artisan.co/talk-to-sales?page_source=/pricing)\n to see how Ava can help you track all your key sales activities with practically no manual input. \n\n  \n\n### 2\\. Sales-Qualified Leads by Source \n\n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Definition:** Sales-qualified leads by source measures the volume of interested leads that come from specific sales and marketing channels. \n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Why it matters:** Tracking new sales-qualified leads by source tells you which of your marketing channels is most effective at generating high-quality leads. Some channels will provide large volumes of low-quality leads while others will generate low volumes of high-quality leads. By measuring sales-qualified leads—leads who have moved some way down your sales funnel and are likely to buy—you can identify those channels that effectively drive _both_ quantity and quality and leverage them further. \n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Examples:** Track the volume of sales-qualified leads by source across _all_ your channels: email marketing, social media, search engine traffic, paid online and offline advertising, referrals, affiliate marketing, events and joint ventures. \n    \n      \n    \n\n### 3\\. Average Lead Response Time (Speed to Lead)\n\n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Definition:** Your average lead response time (also called speed to lead) measures the average time it takes you to respond to a lead once they’ve contacted your company (by filling out a web form or ending an enquiry email, for example). \n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Why it matters:** The faster you can reach out to leads, the more likely they are to convert. [Forbes](https://www.forbes.com/sites/theyec/2019/09/10/step-by-step-guide-to-following-up-with-b2b-leads-generated-by-sdrs/?sh=45eb93cf2309)\n     reports that you’re 100 times more likely to successfully contact a lead if you follow up in under five minutes. If you can reduce your average lead response time, you’ll see gains across other baseline KPIs like sales and revenue.\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Formula:** Average lead response time = Total time taken to respond to leads / Number of leads\n    \n      \n    \n\n![1. Avg Lead Response Time](https://www.artisan.co/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.ctfassets.net%2Fkyprwggh4muz%2F2ny0GS81Sn2mQIgRQFeMUp%2Fb9fcc458da3614eae3879439277ba9df%2F1._Avg_Lead_Response_Time.webp&w=3840&q=75)\n\n### 4\\. Marketing Qualified Leads (MQL) to Sales Qualified Leads (SQL) Conversion Rate\n\n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Definition:** Your MQL-to-SQL rate measures the percentage of leads transitioning from marketing-qualified leads to sales-qualified leads. \n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Why it matters:** Sales teams use different lead-scoring methods to define MQLs and SQLs. However, in all cases the distinction points to levels of interest. An MQL has shown enough interest in your company to be considered likely to buy. An SQL has moved through part of your sales funnel and is considered _highly_ likely to buy. Your MQL-to-SQL strategy indicates the efficacy of your lead nurturing process. A low percentage may point to the fact that your sales team is not engaging adequately with leads generated and their approach needs improving. \n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Formula:** Marketing-qualified leads (MQL) to sales-qualified leads (SQL) conversion rate = (Total Number of SQLs / Total number of MQLs) x 100\n    \n      \n    \n\n![2. MQL to SQL](https://www.artisan.co/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.ctfassets.net%2Fkyprwggh4muz%2F5B9tfdgD7VXiawbI8r8iI4%2Fbc96ed083cb5651064b501a030b987fc%2F2._MQL_to_SQL.webp&w=3840&q=75)\n\n### 5\\. Qualified Lead to Customer Conversion Rate (Sales Close Rate)\n\n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Definition:** Your lead to customer conversion rate measures how many of your qualified leads are converting to customers. Unlike your MQL-to-SQL rate, it tracks the performance of your whole sales funnel, from early stage marketing to the moment a lead signs on the dotted line (or hits that “Pay Now” button). \n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Why it matters:** Your lead to customer conversion rate measures the success of your sales funnel at a very high level. Unlike more specific KPIs that measure individual stages of your funnel, your lead conversion rate gives an overall indicator of the health of your “engine.” Boosting your lead conversion rate will directly impact your revenue and profitability. Qualified leads in this sense encompass both marketing and sales qualified leads. \n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Formula:** Lead conversion rate = (Number of new customers / Number of qualified leads) x 100\n    \n      \n    \n\n![3. Lead Conversion Rate](https://www.artisan.co/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.ctfassets.net%2Fkyprwggh4muz%2F4lCgOC755uq4Oc0ElJr8rE%2F8d62a7b8b6e022c2e778c57074b53eb1%2F3._Lead_Conversion_Rate.webp&w=3840&q=75)\n\nOne of the best ways of increasing your lead conversion rate is to use detailed ideal customer profiles (ICPs) based on up-to-date data. \n\n  \n\n**Artisan’s AI SDR Ava has a database of over 300 million potential leads from which she can target your ICP, all on autopilot.** [Get in touch now](https://www.artisan.co/talk-to-sales?page_source=/pricing)\n to see how Artisan can help you meet your sales targets. \n\n  \n\n### 6\\. Sales Win Rate (Closed-Won Opportunities) \n\n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Definition:** Your sales win rate measures your closed won opportunities against all closed opportunities (closed won opportunities and closed opportunities that didn’t result in a sale). \n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Why it matters:** Your sales win rate shows you how many leads have converted to customers out of all leads who have _completed the sales cycle_. Closed-lost leads have given a definite “no” to your offer or been deemed inactive. This KPI is different to your lead to customer conversion rate or sales close rate because it illustrates how well your sales team is converting leads they’ve actively engaged with into customers. A poor month-by-month lead to customer conversion rate and a high sales win rate may indicate that your sales team is struggling to connect with all leads and many are remaining as open opportunities. \n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Formula:** Win rate = (Closed-won leads / (Closed-won leads + closed-lost leads)) x 100\n    \n      \n    \n\n![4. Sales Win Rate](https://www.artisan.co/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.ctfassets.net%2Fkyprwggh4muz%2F5sn3knoD1MQZomvUnRuCah%2Fcf4ad3a576905c99fb6ec2092cef2e0a%2F4._Sales_Win_Rate.webp&w=3840&q=75)\n\n### 7\\. Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC) \n\n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Definition:** Your customer acquisition cost tells you how much it costs to gain a new customer. \n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Why it matters:** Reducing your customer acquisition cost increases revenue. If the cost of acquiring a customer is reducing over time, it indicates that your marketing and sales team are becoming more efficient, either because of streamlined processes, more effective sales techniques, or the identification of appropriate marketing channels. \n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Formula:** Customer acquisition cost = Total expenditure on sales and marketing / Number of new customers\n    \n      \n    \n\n![5. CAC](https://www.artisan.co/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.ctfassets.net%2Fkyprwggh4muz%2F7nP2DPIEBEclQ4j6het2xG%2Fcf7e9e16767b8fffffcc8cef00010960%2F5._CAC.webp&w=3840&q=75)\n\n### 8\\. Pipeline Velocity\n\n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Definition:** Your pipeline velocity, also called sales velocity, measures the speed at which sales-qualified leads become customers. It’s calculated as revenue per quarter—for example, $100,000/quarter, which represents $100,000 in closed deals over a quarter. \n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Why it matters:** Pipeline velocity measures the efficiency of your later-stage sales funnel and allows you to make revenue forecasts. A low Pipeline velocity may suggest that your sales team is experiencing operational difficulties or their sales techniques could be improved. A higher pipeline velocity means a better return on investment (ROI) for your sales budget. \n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Formula:** Pipeline velocity = (Number of sales-qualified leads x average deal value x win rate) / (Length of sales cycle / 91 (days in a business quarter))\n    \n      \n    \n\n![6. Pipeline Velocity](https://www.artisan.co/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.ctfassets.net%2Fkyprwggh4muz%2F18o01nD9NaKNmHV4MpdpEB%2Fe350c9a8f42d4aca4f8f9db32ff66e31%2F6._Pipeline_Velocity.webp&w=3840&q=75)\n\n### 9.  Customer Retention\n\n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Definition:** Your customer retention rate measures the percentage of customers who stay with you over a given period. It’s closely related to churn rate, which measures the number of customers who leave over the same period. \n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Why it matters:** Your ability to hold onto customers directly impacts your revenue. It costs [four to five times as much](https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbesbusinesscouncil/2022/12/12/customer-retention-versus-customer-acquisition/)\n     to acquire a new customer than retain an existing one. In essence, a high customer retention rate means that your customers are happy and you are effectively building loyalty and long-term satisfaction. This also creates upsell and cross-selling opportunities for you. \n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Formula:** Customer retention rate = (Number customers at end of period - number of customers acquired during period) / Number of customers at start of period\n    \n      \n    \n\n![7. Customer Retention Rate](https://www.artisan.co/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.ctfassets.net%2Fkyprwggh4muz%2F2BP4iVshPsYx35DQy4lvGW%2Febecdb4db15505f7ea6cbf9650a63f2c%2F7._Customer_Retention_Rate.webp&w=3840&q=75)\n\n### 10\\. Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) \n\n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Definition:** Customer lifetime value measures the amount of money a customer will spend with you over their lifetime. This can be quite a tricky KPI to calculate because you need enough data to accurately determine the average length of time a customer remains active in addition to their order value and purchase frequency. \n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Why it matters:** Customer lifetime value tracks three important sales metrics in combination: the average time a customer remains active, how often they make a purchase, and the average value of the purchases they make. It’s a full snapshot of the value of your typical customer. If it’s increasing, it means that you’re providing value, building strong customer relationships, and driving up your average deal size. \n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Formula:** Customer lifetime value = Average order value x Purchase frequency x Customer Lifetime\n    \n      \n    \n\n![8. Customer lifetime value](https://www.artisan.co/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.ctfassets.net%2Fkyprwggh4muz%2F1Rkg3oFPTb5BHA9Lqrsm9q%2F3f19e889ec233b4be906fc7421529056%2F8._Customer_lifetime_value.webp&w=3840&q=75)\n\n### 11\\. Sales Growth Rate\n\n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Definition:** Your sales growth rate measures the volume of sales in your most recent period compared with the previous period. It’s one of the most important growth metrics for a company. \n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Why it matters:** Your sales growth rate is one of the strongest—if not _the_ strongest—measure of your company’s overall growth. If you’re seeing a steady rise in sales growth, it is likely that your sales team is becoming more efficient, the number of deals is increasing, and marketing efforts are going well.\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Formula:** Sales growth rate = ((Sales in most recent period - Sales in previous period) / Sales in the previous period) x 100\n    \n      \n    \n\n![9. Sales growth rate](https://www.artisan.co/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.ctfassets.net%2Fkyprwggh4muz%2F7pliVcYxbkQ0O4rHqGT9BX%2F82abf18bf2389c39daab3db944ee4e72%2F9.__Sales_growth_rate.webp&w=3840&q=75)\n\n### 12\\. Sales Revenue \n\n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Definition:** Sales revenue is a straightforward KPI that looks at the raw revenue from sales over a given period. \n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Why it matters:** Sales revenue is distinct from turnover. For many companies, sales revenue alone makes up total turnover, but this is not always the case. Where other sources, like investment returns, asset sales, subsidies and so on, contribute to turnover, it’s important to differentiate. Month-on-month or year-on-year sales revenue is a useful KPI for measuring long-term sustainable growth. \n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Formula:** Sales revenue = Number of sales x Average sale value\n    \n      \n    \n\n![10. Sales Revenue](https://www.artisan.co/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.ctfassets.net%2Fkyprwggh4muz%2F274Rcvjd623t7Xf0AARdPf%2Fa97c8b0292c7c9b0e75668529a0b4314%2F10.__Sales_Revenue.webp&w=3840&q=75)\n\nStrategies to Set B2B Sales KPIs for Success \n---------------------------------------------\n\nNow we’ve covered the KPIs, let’s look at how to pick the perfect mix to generate new leads and fill your sales pipeline so it’s overflowing with B2B goodness. \n\n  \n\n### 1\\. Select the Right KPIs \n\n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Align with business goals.** Top-tier sales KPIs should align with executive goals which then “cascade” down your organization in the form of more specific KPIs. For example, you may decide on a high-level company goal to double sales revenue. Sales managers may then use pipeline velocity as the KPI to measure movement towards this goal and individual sales reps may be tracked against outreach activity KPIs. \n    \n      \n    \n\n![Right-KPIs](https://www.artisan.co/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.ctfassets.net%2Fkyprwggh4muz%2F44MLpIC49yZq8l9cNPLhPt%2F6ffbda05ed9c2814ee8cfcad3e7ab59a%2FRight-KPIs.webp&w=3840&q=75)\n\n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Analyze historical data.** Analyzing historical data helps you create forecasts that can act as the basis of realistic goals and relevant KPIs. Historical data can also highlight missed opportunities for immediate results. \n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Prioritize actionable metrics.** Use the SMART framework to pick KPIs and sales metrics that are Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-Bound. \n    \n      \n    \n\n![SMART](https://www.artisan.co/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.ctfassets.net%2Fkyprwggh4muz%2F2KvObMWqTdYV8gbhLMGGZ8%2Fc658e02e3e3b05ad3bafe2be61057391%2FSMART.webp&w=3840&q=75)\n\n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Benchmark against industry standards.** Industry standards are widely available, with reputable sources like Gartner, McKinsey, and Forresster often publishing industry-specific benchmarks. Ultimately, your in-house data should be your main guide, but third-party insights have their place. \n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Consult stakeholders.** Involve all decision-makers across your organization to ensure alignment with high-level KPIs. Consider stakeholder mapping to ensure alignment with company-wide goals and specific metrics. \n    \n      \n    \n\n### 2. Keep it Simple, Clear, and Measurable \n\nChoose KPIs that are relevant to different stages of your sales funnel and well-suited to your existing sales processes. Focus on a core set of sales KPIs that are likely to provide the most valuable insights and help you leverage the most prominent growth opportunities. \n\n  \n\nWherever possible, use automation tools to streamline the collection and analysis of data so that you can measure KPIs in real time in a way that is clear and coherent to the whole sales team. \n\n  \n\n### 3. Track Progress Regularly and Adjust \n\nKPIs are dynamic, fluid metrics. Track progress and make adjustments at both the tactical and strategic level as needed. This ensures your chosen KPIs remain relevant and aligned with broad business goals and that team performance stays at an optimal level.\n\n  \n\nHere are some ideas for adjusting your approach:\n\n  \n\n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    Refine lower-tier metrics  \n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    Update performance benchmarks\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    Explore ways to improve data quality  \n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    Add greater detail to reporting  \n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    Explore possible automations \n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    Gather qualitative feedback feedback  \n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    Adjust timeframes based on sales performance\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    Test and integrate new tools \n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    Realignment incentives where appropriate\n    \n      \n    \n\n  \n\nIn addition, it’s important to ensure that your whole team is involved in the brainstorming process, as they will often have insights into both the best sales opportunities and where sales strategies are experiencing issues and bottlenecks. \n\n  \n\n### 4.

Techniques and Tools for Growth\n===========================================================\n\nUpdated On: July 31, 2024\n\n15 minutes read\n\n![copy-link](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/copy-link.svg)[![copy-link](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/mail.svg)](mailto:?body=https://www.artisan.co/blog/b2b-outbound-sales)\n\n![What is B2B Outbound Sales? Techniques and Tools for Growth](https://www.artisan.co/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.ctfassets.net%2Fkyprwggh4muz%2F4sV0vXLEu2DhEOuTT4wksF%2F26bcb35ddd66a598055b3525b8d1c11b%2FCover__5_.webp&w=3840&q=75)\n\nLove them or hate them, B2B outbound sales strategies are fundamental for thriving B2B companies—and for a good reason. \n\n  \n\nThe B2B buyer journey is often a long, multi-touch process requiring buy-in from multiple stakeholders.\n\n  \n\nWhile inbound sales techniques allow B2B companies to attract potential buyers, inbound strategies alone can't take prospects from the beginning to the end of a complex sales journey—you need outbound to make that happen. \n\n  \n\nHowever, complex sales cycles aren't the only reason B2B companies use outbound. It's also what the buyers want. \n\n  \n\n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    Recent research shows that [71% of buyers](https://www.rainsalestraining.com/blog/when-do-buyers-want-to-talk-to-sellers-the-time-is-now)\n     actually want salespeople to reach out when they're looking for solutions. \n    \n      \n    \n\n  \n\nB2B outbound sales enable companies to quickly target high-value prospects and key decision-makers and foster those connections until the deal is closed. \n\n  \n\nUnfortunately, in the age of call screening, spam filters, and social media blocking, getting a hold of your prospects isn't easy. It's also time-consuming and resource-draining. \n\n  \n![Scams](https://www.artisan.co/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.ctfassets.net%2Fkyprwggh4muz%2F14VvuJPaeOluh0WndUMinq%2Fd91bd46d22e8fe1fb85a755011452ae3%2FScams.webp&w=3840&q=75)\n\n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    No wonder [52% of outbound marketers](https://spotio.com/blog/sales-statistics/#:~:text=14.-,Outbound%20Sales%20Statistics,prior%20to%20making%20a%20call.)\n     say their current efforts are ineffective. \n    \n      \n    \n\n  \n\nIn this guide, we'll examine some common outbound sales channels and the benefits of using outbound techniques. We'll also share some strategies to help you level up your B2B outbound sales strategies. \n\n  \n\n**What is Outbound Sales?**\n---------------------------\n\nSo, what is outbound sales, and how do it differ from inbound sales? \n\n  \n\n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Outbound sales** is a proactive sales approach where salespeople identify leads and initiate contact via email, cold calling, or direct messages. \n    \n      \n    \n\n  \n\nOutbound sales are all about finding and converting leads quickly – which is super valuable since, according to HubSpot, [74% of companies](https://www.hubspot.com/marketing-statistics?__hstc=11361899.426d6d3a92ea56dcf2cf0e90bfead9e7.1720787822260.1720787822260.1720802553571.2&__hssc=11361899.1.1720802553571&__hsfp=1809682446)\n say converting leads in their CRM into paying customers is their top priority. \n\n  \n\n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Inbound sales** take a more passive approach. Despite its name, inbound sales is more of a marketing function focusing on attracting prospects via social media, content marketing, and search engine optimization. It encourages those prospects to engage with the company when they're ready.  \n    \n      \n    \n\nIf the differences are still a bit blurry, here are some key differences between the two:\n\n  \n\n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Who makes the first move** – In outbound sales, the sales rep makes the first move, but in inbound sales, the prospects tend to reach out first. \n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Time to results** – Outbound sales are excellent for quick results, whereas inbound sales are best for gradual growth. \n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Prospect targeting** – B2B outbound sales are all about precisely targeting particular market segments, while inbound sales involve more broad targeting methods.\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Primary tactics** – Outbound sales tactics include cold emailing, cold calling, DMs, direct mail, and networking. Inbound sales tactics include social media posts, SEO, blogs, eBooks, and webinars.\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **The costs** – Inbound sales usually cost more to get started but less to keep going than outbound sales. That's because outbound sales traditionally cost more due to the high price of talent and tools (though this is changing with the arrival of [AI BDRs, like Ava](https://www.artisan.co/ai-sales-agent)\n    .)  \n    \n      \n    \n\n  \n\nSo, which is better for your organization? Neither—they're _both_ essential functions for healthy B2B companies. \n\n  \n\nInbound sales build a strong pipeline of engaged prospects, while outbound sales ensure you don't miss any opportunities by targeting high-value accounts that can drive significant growth. By integrating both, you maximize your chances of converting and hitting your KPIs.\n\n  \n\n**4 Common B2B Outbound Sales Channels for Lead Generation**\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\nB2B outbound sales are all about generating leads to pitch and close. Here are some of the most common [B2B sales channels](https://www.artisan.co/blog/b2b-sales-channels)\n.   \n\n  \n\n### **Cold Calling**\n\nCold calling involves calling prospects who haven't expressed prior interest in your products or services. While many sales reps overlook making sales calls, they shouldn't because, according to recent data, [57% of C-Level and VP-Level buyers](https://www.close.com/blog/39-shocking-stats-that-will-change-the-way-you-sell)\n prefer to connect on the phone. \n\n  \n\n**How to be successful**: Success in cold calling depends on preparation, understanding the prospect's needs, and delivering a compelling value proposition. Generally, having a sales script and a clear goal for each call is important. For example, the goal of the first call may be pre-qualifying the prospect, understanding their key pain points, and taking notes about them in your CRM so that you're better prepared to close on the second or third call. \n\n  \n\n### **Cold Emails** \n\nCold emails are unsolicited emails sent to potential leads to introduce your business. Generally, cold emails are sent in sequences—or multiple emails sent at specific, pre-determined intervals. However, they can also be one-off messages sent with the goal of initiating contact.  \n\n  \n![Cold Emails](https://www.artisan.co/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.ctfassets.net%2Fkyprwggh4muz%2Fqu8R3QtfQXZlvW5NSzJyr%2Ff5b12779c81a7e23a468ac07caf2580f%2FOutbound.webp&w=3840&q=75)\n\n**How to be successful**: Effective cold emails are personalized, concise, and offer clear value. They should have a strong subject line since [69% of email recipients](https://optinmonster.com/101-email-subject-lines-your-subscribers-cant-resist/#:~:text=or%20ignore%20it.-,Why%20Is%20a%20Good%20Email%20Subject%20Line%20Important%3F,break%20your%20email%20marketing%20campaigns.)\n send emails to spam based only on their headline! They should also have a tailored message and a clear call to action. Automation tools can help manage and scale these campaigns. \n\n  \n\n**_Want to automate your outbound?_** _With our_ [AI BDR Ava](https://www.artisan.co/ai-sales-agent)\n_, you can launch your campaign to targeted prospects in minutes and avoid spam filters with mailbox health monitoring, placement tests, email warmup, and more._ \n\n  \n\n### **Social Selling**\n\nSocial selling is an approach that utilizes social media platforms to connect with and nurture potential leads. LinkedIn is particularly powerful for B2B social selling, enabling connections with decision-makers and industry leaders. \n\n  \n\n**How to be successful**: Every niche and platform has its own eccentricities, but, in general, sales professionals can build relationships with potential clients by sharing valuable content, engaging in conversations, and demonstrating expertise. Influencer marketing and partnerships may also be beneficial. \n\n  \n\n### **Networking Events & Webinars** \n\nNetworking events, like industry conferences, trade shows, and local meetups, are excellent opportunities to meet potential customers face-to-face, build relationships, and gather insights. \n\n  \n\nWebinars allow you to reach a broad online audience, highlight your expertise, and establish thought leadership to a broad audience. \n\n  \n\n**How to be successful**: Preparation is key for in-person events. Reach out to prospects before events to schedule a time to chat. Bring your business cards, but more importantly, be ready to network. Remember to show genuine interest and try to connect with people. In other words, don't go straight for the pitch. Instead, focus on connecting and making positive impressions with potential clients. \n\n  \n\nIf you're hosting a webinar, be sure to provide value to the attendees. If prospects feel like they were reeled into a webinar just to become a lead in your sales funnel, it'll leave a bad taste in their mouths. Think of it as an introduction to who your company is, and do your best to make sure it's a good first impression. \n\n  \n\nIf you're attending a webinar, come with questions to ask and be a vocal and active contributor. It's much harder to connect and make an impression with online events, so plan how to make your mark. \n\n  \n\n**B2B Outbound Sales Benefits** \n--------------------------------\n\nWhat makes B2B outbound sales particularly powerful? Here are some of the key benefits\n\n  \n\n### **Target the Right Audience** \n\nOutbound sales let you directly target your ideal audience. Instead of waiting for prospects to find you, you can reach out to those who fit your customer profile. Whether you buy leads, use a database, or scrape the web for prospects – with outbound sales, you can laser-focus on the types of companies that are the right fit for your offer. \n\n  \n\nThis focused approach boosts the chances of conversion because you're actually targeting the right prospects. More importantly, though, it maximizes the sales teams' efforts. Outbound sales enable companies to zero in on their target audience, saving time and energy while boosting results. \n\n  \n\n### **Personalized Outreach** \n\nOutbound sales enable personalized outreach and allow you to tailor your message to your prospect's specific needs – and there are few things more powerful than a highly targeted message.  \n\n  \n![Cold Emails](https://www.artisan.co/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.ctfassets.net%2Fkyprwggh4muz%2F6Gm1hotoLwqr5zSK6fMeM6%2Fd61e6fecf0c41ad514d8f9cf85e13004%2FCold_Emails.webp&w=3840&q=75)\n\nResearch has shown that companies that excel at personalization have [40% more revenue](https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/growth-marketing-and-sales/our-insights/the-value-of-getting-personalization-right-or-wrong-is-multiplying)\n than their competitors who don't. Additionally, personalized messages have been proven to have a greater response rate than messages that don’t. \n\n  \n\n**_Artisan's AI BDR Ava scrapes the web and social media to find insights to craft highly personalized emails._** [Try Ava Now.](https://www.artisan.co/ai-sales-agent)\n\n  \n\n### **Shorten Sales Cycle** \n\nOutbound sales can accelerate the sales cycle. By initiating contact, you can move prospects through the sales funnel faster. You aren't waiting for them to make the first move (or take the next one). \n\n  \n\nWith outbound sales, you can address objections, provide information, and guide prospects toward a purchase more efficiently than trying to drive them through the process with inbound techniques alone. \n\n  \n\n### **Boost Inbound Marketing** \n\nInbound and outbound sales shouldn't be competing with one another. Instead, they should work in tandem, helping move prospects through the buyer journey. \n\n  \n\nWhile it's easy to see how inbound leads and strategies like content marketing and SEO can help outbound, it's not always as easy to see how outbound can also help inbound teams. However, direct interactions with prospects provide valuable insights that can improve your content and strategies. Outbound efforts also drive traffic to your inbound channels, which increases overall engagement and visibility.\n\n  \n\n**6 Strategies for Successful B2B Outbound Sales** \n---------------------------------------------------\n\nWhile every company's B2B outbound sales strategy will vary based on its specific team, goals, and needs, every successful strategy includes six basic steps. \n\n  \n\n### **1\\. B2B Outbound Prospecting**\n\nProspecting is simply the process of finding and engaging with potential customers. However, when doing B2B outbound sales, you obviously can't just pick up the phone book and start dialing random numbers. \n\n  \n![b2b-1](https://www.artisan.co/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.ctfassets.net%2Fkyprwggh4muz%2F2P5r8cGiznHc069M9e3lxm%2F9b9375e62b7e8d4f394ac6e2ba0c1b90%2Fb2b_contacts.webp&w=3840&q=75)\n\nInstead, you have to get _really_ good at sales prospecting, which starts by identifying your ideal customer profile (ICP). An ICP is a detailed description of the type of customer that would benefit the most from your product or service. \n\n  \n\nTo identify your ICP, you can start by analyzing your current customers and identifying common characteristics among your best customers, considering factors like:\n\n  \n\n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Industry**: Which sectors do your best customers belong to?\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Company Size**: What is the employee count or revenue range of your ideal customers?\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Location**: Are your best customers concentrated in specific geographical areas?\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Challenges**: What common problems or pain points do your best customers face that your solution addresses?\n    \n      \n    \n\n  \n\nCreating a well-defined ICP helps you focus your outbound sales efforts on prospects most likely to convert and makes it much easier to build a prospect list. \n\n  \n\nOnce you know who your ICP is, you can use web scraping tools, lead databases, or tools like LinkedIn Sales Navigator or the [AI BDR, Ava](https://www.artisan.co/ai-sales-agent)\n, to build a prospect list. \n\n  \n\nOf course, not every prospect you find will be a perfect match. So, take some time to read and evaluate each prospect to ensure they're a good fit for your product or service before pouring tons of resources into reaching out.  \n\n  \n\n### **2\\. Outreach Qualified Leads**\n\nOnce you've got a strong list of potential customers, it's time to start the outreach process, and spoiler alert: _generic messages won't cut it_. To optimize your conversion rates, you need to personalize your outreach to address each person's specific needs and challenges. \n\n  \n\nTo personalize, you'll have to do some basic research on the prospect's business to uncover contact information and other details like:\n\n  \n\n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    The company's industry \n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    The prospect's name\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    The company name\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    Recent accolades \n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    The pain points the company is experiencing\n    \n      \n    \n\n  \n\nThen, you'll want to highlight all these things in your outreach. \n\n  \n\nIt's also important to choose the right channel for reaching out since different channels can be more effective for certain industries and instances. For example, if your ICP is a technology startup, you might focus on LinkedIn since [82% of B2B marketers](https://www.intelusagency.com/blog/linkedin-b2b-lead-generation)\n agree it's the best channel for B2B lead generation.  \n\n  \n\nWhen planning your outreach strategy for your outbound sales team, you also need to develop a strategy for bypassing gatekeepers. \n\n  \n\n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Gatekeepers** are the receptionists or assistants who often screen communications for decision-makers. \n    \n      \n    \n\n  \n\nThings like building rapport with the gatekeeper and using multiple channels (email, social media, calls) can maximize your chances of getting through. \n\n  \n![b2b-1](https://www.artisan.co/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.ctfassets.net%2Fkyprwggh4muz%2F54QzQw32vipDrE7FtegfQ2%2Fcf3c7e49ba3b59c1f7204ba518000d16%2Fava1.webp&w=3840&q=75)\n\n**_Ava is an AI BDR who automates 80% of the outbound sales process and can be set up with a 10-minute conversation._** _Ava creates the user's ICP, prospects with her database of over 270M contacts, does lead research, and crafts & sends highly bespoke email sequences. Want to_ [give her a spin](https://www.artisan.co/ai-sales-agent)\n_?_\n\n  \n\n### **3\\. Qualification and Needs Assessment**\n\nOnce you've engaged a prospect, the next step is to schedule a meeting to qualify the prospect and learn more about them. \n\n  \n\nFor this first call, be upfront about what prospects should expect by establishing a clear agenda ahead of time. This can go a long way towards establishing your expertise and building trust. \n\n  \n\nYour primary goal should be to find the specific challenges and pain points the prospect is facing so you can ensure they're the right fit and better tailor a sales pitch for their unique needs and goals. \n\n  \n\nDuring the discovery call: \n\n  \n\n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Ask open-ended questions** to encourage the prospect to elaborate on their issues and actively listen to their answers. \n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Take notes and ask follow-up questions** to gain deeper insights. Try to uncover as much about the decision-making process early on as possible.\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Gently probe for budget information** to ensure your solution aligns with their financial capabilities. Ask questions like: \"What kind of budget do you have allocated for this project?\" to get a sense of their financial constraints. \n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Identify the key decision-makers** within the organization. This can be done by asking, \"Who else should be involved in this conversation?\" or \"Who will be making the final decision?\"\n    \n      \n    \n\n  \n\nKeep in mind you shouldn't try to close them during this call. On average, it takes [18 calls to connect](https://blog.hubspot.com/sales/sales-statistics)\n with a potential buyer and five additional follow-up calls to actually close the deal. \n\n  \n\nTaking the time to thoroughly qualify prospects and conducting a detailed needs assessment enables you to focus your efforts on leads with the largest potential to convert, saving time and resources while setting the stage for a successful sales engagement.\n\n  \n\n### **4\\. Value Proposition and Presentation**\n\nIt may take several calls with several different stakeholders to get to this point, but once you get the opportunity to do a formal pitch – it's important to be prepared. \n\n  \n\nStart by preparing a personalized presentation highlighting how your product or service addresses the specific challenges and pain points discussed during the discovery call. \n\n  \n\nFor the best results: \n\n  \n\n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Use success stories and social proof**, such as case studies and testimonials, to demonstrate the tangible benefits and results your solution has provided to similar companies.\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Try to handle objections confidently and effectively**. Be prepared to address common concerns and questions and provide clear, concise responses that reinforce the value of your offering. \n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Listen and respond to objections**. Like in the discovery call, it's important to listen to the prospect's objections, understand their underlying concerns, and tailor your responses to alleviate those worries.\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Use visuals**, like slides, infographics, and videos, to make your points more compelling and easier to understand. \n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Encourage questions and discussions** throughout the presentation to keep the prospect interested and to address any issues in real-time.\n    \n      \n    \n\n  \n\nBy personalizing your pitch and confidently handling objections, you can ensure your presentation resonates with your prospects and moves them closer to a purchasing decision.\n\n  \n\n### **5\\. Negotiation and Closing the Deal**\n\nThis is the stage in the B2B outbound sales process where your sales skills really come into play. There's usually a bit of persuasion, negotiation, and lots of persistence. \n\n  \n\nIt's best to strive for win-win negotiations where both parties feel like they're gaining value. Make sure you clearly communicate the benefits of your solution and be prepared to discuss pricing, terms, and any potential adjustments. \n\n  \n![ava1](https://www.artisan.co/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.ctfassets.net%2Fkyprwggh4muz%2F167nzEBCI7bnBDxWnGTeXP%2F9a9e729db409ce953e1f701152752fb0%2Fb2b.webp&w=3840&q=75)\n\nIt's important to be flexible during this phase, but it's equally important to stand firm on the value your product or service provides. Be sure to outline clear next steps to keep the momentum going. Your prospects should always know how to move forward with the deal. \n\n  \n\nAfter reaching an agreement, it may seem like your job is done, but consistent follow-up is crucial at this phase. It's not uncommon for deals to die in the pipeline – even after the prospect has agreed to move forward. \n\n  \n\nRegularly check in to address any lingering concerns and keep the prospect engaged. Use follow-up calls, emails, or meetings to reinforce the benefits of your solution and keep the deal moving forward.\n\n  \n\n### **6\\. Building Relationships and Account Management**\n\nAfter closing the deal, the focus shifts to building a strong, long-term relationship with the client, which starts with a smooth onboarding experience.  \n\n  \n\nOnce your client has signed the dotted line, be sure to guide them through the initial steps of using your product or service and point them to any other people they need to be aware of (i.e., account managers, customer support staff, etc.)\n\n  \n\nThis stage may be more of an account manager or customer success function. Regardless, someone in your company needs to:  \n\n  \n\n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Schedule periodic check-ins** to discuss the client's progress, address any issues, and gather feedback.\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Identify opportunities to upsell or cross-sell** additional products or services that can provide further value to the client.   \n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Quickly resolve issues** and be responsive to their questions to strengthen their loyalty and ensure a positive experience. \n    \n      \n    \n\n  \n\nHappy clients are more likely to become repeat customers and refer your business to others. Who doesn't want that? \n\n  \n\n**Optimize Your B2B Outbound Sales Strategy With AI** \n------------------------------------------------------\n\nOutbound sales is an important function for almost every thriving B2B organization. It's an effective strategy for reaching prospects, getting quick results, and growing your organization. \n\n  \n\nHowever, it's not a walk in the park. Being good at B2B outbound sales requires you to be skilled at things like overcoming rejection, identifying the right decision-makers, crafting compelling pitches, and more. \n\n  \n\nIt's a lot to balance. However, AI SDRs can address many of these challenges and streamline the pain points of outbound sales tremendously. \n\n  \n![Automate](https://www.artisan.co/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.ctfassets.net%2Fkyprwggh4muz%2F5nd40Fv7djsc8vGSWYzxMy%2Fd17616e3c3848bd69cda652cf590dc82%2FAutomate.webp&w=3840&q=75)\n\nFor example, [Ava, Artisan's AI SDR](https://www.artisan.co/ai-sales-agent)\n, can automate 80% of the sales process.

Techniques and Tools for Growth\n===========================================================\n\nUpdated On: July 31, 2024\n\n15 minutes read\n\n![copy-link](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/copy-link.svg)[![copy-link](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/mail.svg)](mailto:?body=https://www.artisan.co/blog/b2b-outbound-sales)\n\n![What is B2B Outbound Sales? Techniques and Tools for Growth](https://www.artisan.co/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.ctfassets.net%2Fkyprwggh4muz%2F4sV0vXLEu2DhEOuTT4wksF%2F26bcb35ddd66a598055b3525b8d1c11b%2FCover__5_.webp&w=3840&q=75)\n\nLove them or hate them, B2B outbound sales strategies are fundamental for thriving B2B companies—and for a good reason. \n\n  \n\nThe B2B buyer journey is often a long, multi-touch process requiring buy-in from multiple stakeholders.\n\n  \n\nWhile inbound sales techniques allow B2B companies to attract potential buyers, inbound strategies alone can't take prospects from the beginning to the end of a complex sales journey—you need outbound to make that happen. \n\n  \n\nHowever, complex sales cycles aren't the only reason B2B companies use outbound. It's also what the buyers want. \n\n  \n\n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    Recent research shows that [71% of buyers](https://www.rainsalestraining.com/blog/when-do-buyers-want-to-talk-to-sellers-the-time-is-now)\n     actually want salespeople to reach out when they're looking for solutions. \n    \n      \n    \n\n  \n\nB2B outbound sales enable companies to quickly target high-value prospects and key decision-makers and foster those connections until the deal is closed. \n\n  \n\nUnfortunately, in the age of call screening, spam filters, and social media blocking, getting a hold of your prospects isn't easy. It's also time-consuming and resource-draining. \n\n  \n![Scams](https://www.artisan.co/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.ctfassets.net%2Fkyprwggh4muz%2F14VvuJPaeOluh0WndUMinq%2Fd91bd46d22e8fe1fb85a755011452ae3%2FScams.webp&w=3840&q=75)\n\n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    No wonder [52% of outbound marketers](https://spotio.com/blog/sales-statistics/#:~:text=14.-,Outbound%20Sales%20Statistics,prior%20to%20making%20a%20call.)\n     say their current efforts are ineffective. \n    \n      \n    \n\n  \n\nIn this guide, we'll examine some common outbound sales channels and the benefits of using outbound techniques. We'll also share some strategies to help you level up your B2B outbound sales strategies. \n\n  \n\n**What is Outbound Sales?**\n---------------------------\n\nSo, what is outbound sales, and how do it differ from inbound sales? \n\n  \n\n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Outbound sales** is a proactive sales approach where salespeople identify leads and initiate contact via email, cold calling, or direct messages. \n    \n      \n    \n\n  \n\nOutbound sales are all about finding and converting leads quickly – which is super valuable since, according to HubSpot, [74% of companies](https://www.hubspot.com/marketing-statistics?__hstc=11361899.426d6d3a92ea56dcf2cf0e90bfead9e7.1720787822260.1720787822260.1720802553571.2&__hssc=11361899.1.1720802553571&__hsfp=1809682446)\n say converting leads in their CRM into paying customers is their top priority. \n\n  \n\n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Inbound sales** take a more passive approach. Despite its name, inbound sales is more of a marketing function focusing on attracting prospects via social media, content marketing, and search engine optimization. It encourages those prospects to engage with the company when they're ready.  \n    \n      \n    \n\nIf the differences are still a bit blurry, here are some key differences between the two:\n\n  \n\n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Who makes the first move** – In outbound sales, the sales rep makes the first move, but in inbound sales, the prospects tend to reach out first. \n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Time to results** – Outbound sales are excellent for quick results, whereas inbound sales are best for gradual growth. \n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Prospect targeting** – B2B outbound sales are all about precisely targeting particular market segments, while inbound sales involve more broad targeting methods.\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Primary tactics** – Outbound sales tactics include cold emailing, cold calling, DMs, direct mail, and networking. Inbound sales tactics include social media posts, SEO, blogs, eBooks, and webinars.\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **The costs** – Inbound sales usually cost more to get started but less to keep going than outbound sales. That's because outbound sales traditionally cost more due to the high price of talent and tools (though this is changing with the arrival of [AI BDRs, like Ava](https://www.artisan.co/ai-sales-agent)\n    .)  \n    \n      \n    \n\n  \n\nSo, which is better for your organization? Neither—they're _both_ essential functions for healthy B2B companies. \n\n  \n\nInbound sales build a strong pipeline of engaged prospects, while outbound sales ensure you don't miss any opportunities by targeting high-value accounts that can drive significant growth. By integrating both, you maximize your chances of converting and hitting your KPIs.\n\n  \n\n**4 Common B2B Outbound Sales Channels for Lead Generation**\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\nB2B outbound sales are all about generating leads to pitch and close. Here are some of the most common [B2B sales channels](https://www.artisan.co/blog/b2b-sales-channels)\n.   \n\n  \n\n### **Cold Calling**\n\nCold calling involves calling prospects who haven't expressed prior interest in your products or services. While many sales reps overlook making sales calls, they shouldn't because, according to recent data, [57% of C-Level and VP-Level buyers](https://www.close.com/blog/39-shocking-stats-that-will-change-the-way-you-sell)\n prefer to connect on the phone. \n\n  \n\n**How to be successful**: Success in cold calling depends on preparation, understanding the prospect's needs, and delivering a compelling value proposition. Generally, having a sales script and a clear goal for each call is important. For example, the goal of the first call may be pre-qualifying the prospect, understanding their key pain points, and taking notes about them in your CRM so that you're better prepared to close on the second or third call. \n\n  \n\n### **Cold Emails** \n\nCold emails are unsolicited emails sent to potential leads to introduce your business. Generally, cold emails are sent in sequences—or multiple emails sent at specific, pre-determined intervals. However, they can also be one-off messages sent with the goal of initiating contact.  \n\n  \n![Cold Emails](https://www.artisan.co/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.ctfassets.net%2Fkyprwggh4muz%2Fqu8R3QtfQXZlvW5NSzJyr%2Ff5b12779c81a7e23a468ac07caf2580f%2FOutbound.webp&w=3840&q=75)\n\n**How to be successful**: Effective cold emails are personalized, concise, and offer clear value. They should have a strong subject line since [69% of email recipients](https://optinmonster.com/101-email-subject-lines-your-subscribers-cant-resist/#:~:text=or%20ignore%20it.-,Why%20Is%20a%20Good%20Email%20Subject%20Line%20Important%3F,break%20your%20email%20marketing%20campaigns.)\n send emails to spam based only on their headline! They should also have a tailored message and a clear call to action. Automation tools can help manage and scale these campaigns. \n\n  \n\n**_Want to automate your outbound?_** _With our_ [AI BDR Ava](https://www.artisan.co/ai-sales-agent)\n_, you can launch your campaign to targeted prospects in minutes and avoid spam filters with mailbox health monitoring, placement tests, email warmup, and more._ \n\n  \n\n### **Social Selling**\n\nSocial selling is an approach that utilizes social media platforms to connect with and nurture potential leads. LinkedIn is particularly powerful for B2B social selling, enabling connections with decision-makers and industry leaders. \n\n  \n\n**How to be successful**: Every niche and platform has its own eccentricities, but, in general, sales professionals can build relationships with potential clients by sharing valuable content, engaging in conversations, and demonstrating expertise. Influencer marketing and partnerships may also be beneficial. \n\n  \n\n### **Networking Events & Webinars** \n\nNetworking events, like industry conferences, trade shows, and local meetups, are excellent opportunities to meet potential customers face-to-face, build relationships, and gather insights. \n\n  \n\nWebinars allow you to reach a broad online audience, highlight your expertise, and establish thought leadership to a broad audience. \n\n  \n\n**How to be successful**: Preparation is key for in-person events. Reach out to prospects before events to schedule a time to chat. Bring your business cards, but more importantly, be ready to network. Remember to show genuine interest and try to connect with people. In other words, don't go straight for the pitch. Instead, focus on connecting and making positive impressions with potential clients. \n\n  \n\nIf you're hosting a webinar, be sure to provide value to the attendees. If prospects feel like they were reeled into a webinar just to become a lead in your sales funnel, it'll leave a bad taste in their mouths. Think of it as an introduction to who your company is, and do your best to make sure it's a good first impression. \n\n  \n\nIf you're attending a webinar, come with questions to ask and be a vocal and active contributor. It's much harder to connect and make an impression with online events, so plan how to make your mark. \n\n  \n\n**B2B Outbound Sales Benefits** \n--------------------------------\n\nWhat makes B2B outbound sales particularly powerful? Here are some of the key benefits\n\n  \n\n### **Target the Right Audience** \n\nOutbound sales let you directly target your ideal audience. Instead of waiting for prospects to find you, you can reach out to those who fit your customer profile. Whether you buy leads, use a database, or scrape the web for prospects – with outbound sales, you can laser-focus on the types of companies that are the right fit for your offer. \n\n  \n\nThis focused approach boosts the chances of conversion because you're actually targeting the right prospects. More importantly, though, it maximizes the sales teams' efforts. Outbound sales enable companies to zero in on their target audience, saving time and energy while boosting results. \n\n  \n\n### **Personalized Outreach** \n\nOutbound sales enable personalized outreach and allow you to tailor your message to your prospect's specific needs – and there are few things more powerful than a highly targeted message.  \n\n  \n![Cold Emails](https://www.artisan.co/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.ctfassets.net%2Fkyprwggh4muz%2F6Gm1hotoLwqr5zSK6fMeM6%2Fd61e6fecf0c41ad514d8f9cf85e13004%2FCold_Emails.webp&w=3840&q=75)\n\nResearch has shown that companies that excel at personalization have [40% more revenue](https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/growth-marketing-and-sales/our-insights/the-value-of-getting-personalization-right-or-wrong-is-multiplying)\n than their competitors who don't. Additionally, personalized messages have been proven to have a greater response rate than messages that don’t. \n\n  \n\n**_Artisan's AI BDR Ava scrapes the web and social media to find insights to craft highly personalized emails._** [Try Ava Now.](https://www.artisan.co/ai-sales-agent)\n\n  \n\n### **Shorten Sales Cycle** \n\nOutbound sales can accelerate the sales cycle. By initiating contact, you can move prospects through the sales funnel faster. You aren't waiting for them to make the first move (or take the next one). \n\n  \n\nWith outbound sales, you can address objections, provide information, and guide prospects toward a purchase more efficiently than trying to drive them through the process with inbound techniques alone. \n\n  \n\n### **Boost Inbound Marketing** \n\nInbound and outbound sales shouldn't be competing with one another. Instead, they should work in tandem, helping move prospects through the buyer journey. \n\n  \n\nWhile it's easy to see how inbound leads and strategies like content marketing and SEO can help outbound, it's not always as easy to see how outbound can also help inbound teams. However, direct interactions with prospects provide valuable insights that can improve your content and strategies. Outbound efforts also drive traffic to your inbound channels, which increases overall engagement and visibility.\n\n  \n\n**6 Strategies for Successful B2B Outbound Sales** \n---------------------------------------------------\n\nWhile every company's B2B outbound sales strategy will vary based on its specific team, goals, and needs, every successful strategy includes six basic steps. \n\n  \n\n### **1\\. B2B Outbound Prospecting**\n\nProspecting is simply the process of finding and engaging with potential customers. However, when doing B2B outbound sales, you obviously can't just pick up the phone book and start dialing random numbers. \n\n  \n![b2b-1](https://www.artisan.co/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.ctfassets.net%2Fkyprwggh4muz%2F2P5r8cGiznHc069M9e3lxm%2F9b9375e62b7e8d4f394ac6e2ba0c1b90%2Fb2b_contacts.webp&w=3840&q=75)\n\nInstead, you have to get _really_ good at sales prospecting, which starts by identifying your ideal customer profile (ICP). An ICP is a detailed description of the type of customer that would benefit the most from your product or service. \n\n  \n\nTo identify your ICP, you can start by analyzing your current customers and identifying common characteristics among your best customers, considering factors like:\n\n  \n\n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Industry**: Which sectors do your best customers belong to?\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Company Size**: What is the employee count or revenue range of your ideal customers?\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Location**: Are your best customers concentrated in specific geographical areas?\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Challenges**: What common problems or pain points do your best customers face that your solution addresses?\n    \n      \n    \n\n  \n\nCreating a well-defined ICP helps you focus your outbound sales efforts on prospects most likely to convert and makes it much easier to build a prospect list. \n\n  \n\nOnce you know who your ICP is, you can use web scraping tools, lead databases, or tools like LinkedIn Sales Navigator or the [AI BDR, Ava](https://www.artisan.co/ai-sales-agent)\n, to build a prospect list. \n\n  \n\nOf course, not every prospect you find will be a perfect match. So, take some time to read and evaluate each prospect to ensure they're a good fit for your product or service before pouring tons of resources into reaching out.  \n\n  \n\n### **2\\. Outreach Qualified Leads**\n\nOnce you've got a strong list of potential customers, it's time to start the outreach process, and spoiler alert: _generic messages won't cut it_. To optimize your conversion rates, you need to personalize your outreach to address each person's specific needs and challenges. \n\n  \n\nTo personalize, you'll have to do some basic research on the prospect's business to uncover contact information and other details like:\n\n  \n\n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    The company's industry \n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    The prospect's name\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    The company name\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    Recent accolades \n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    The pain points the company is experiencing\n    \n      \n    \n\n  \n\nThen, you'll want to highlight all these things in your outreach. \n\n  \n\nIt's also important to choose the right channel for reaching out since different channels can be more effective for certain industries and instances. For example, if your ICP is a technology startup, you might focus on LinkedIn since [82% of B2B marketers](https://www.intelusagency.com/blog/linkedin-b2b-lead-generation)\n agree it's the best channel for B2B lead generation.  \n\n  \n\nWhen planning your outreach strategy for your outbound sales team, you also need to develop a strategy for bypassing gatekeepers. \n\n  \n\n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Gatekeepers** are the receptionists or assistants who often screen communications for decision-makers. \n    \n      \n    \n\n  \n\nThings like building rapport with the gatekeeper and using multiple channels (email, social media, calls) can maximize your chances of getting through. \n\n  \n![b2b-1](https://www.artisan.co/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.ctfassets.net%2Fkyprwggh4muz%2F54QzQw32vipDrE7FtegfQ2%2Fcf3c7e49ba3b59c1f7204ba518000d16%2Fava1.webp&w=3840&q=75)\n\n**_Ava is an AI BDR who automates 80% of the outbound sales process and can be set up with a 10-minute conversation._** _Ava creates the user's ICP, prospects with her database of over 270M contacts, does lead research, and crafts & sends highly bespoke email sequences. Want to_ [give her a spin](https://www.artisan.co/ai-sales-agent)\n_?_\n\n  \n\n### **3\\. Qualification and Needs Assessment**\n\nOnce you've engaged a prospect, the next step is to schedule a meeting to qualify the prospect and learn more about them. \n\n  \n\nFor this first call, be upfront about what prospects should expect by establishing a clear agenda ahead of time. This can go a long way towards establishing your expertise and building trust. \n\n  \n\nYour primary goal should be to find the specific challenges and pain points the prospect is facing so you can ensure they're the right fit and better tailor a sales pitch for their unique needs and goals. \n\n  \n\nDuring the discovery call: \n\n  \n\n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Ask open-ended questions** to encourage the prospect to elaborate on their issues and actively listen to their answers. \n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Take notes and ask follow-up questions** to gain deeper insights. Try to uncover as much about the decision-making process early on as possible.\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Gently probe for budget information** to ensure your solution aligns with their financial capabilities. Ask questions like: \"What kind of budget do you have allocated for this project?\" to get a sense of their financial constraints. \n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Identify the key decision-makers** within the organization. This can be done by asking, \"Who else should be involved in this conversation?\" or \"Who will be making the final decision?\"\n    \n      \n    \n\n  \n\nKeep in mind you shouldn't try to close them during this call. On average, it takes [18 calls to connect](https://blog.hubspot.com/sales/sales-statistics)\n with a potential buyer and five additional follow-up calls to actually close the deal. \n\n  \n\nTaking the time to thoroughly qualify prospects and conducting a detailed needs assessment enables you to focus your efforts on leads with the largest potential to convert, saving time and resources while setting the stage for a successful sales engagement.\n\n  \n\n### **4\\. Value Proposition and Presentation**\n\nIt may take several calls with several different stakeholders to get to this point, but once you get the opportunity to do a formal pitch – it's important to be prepared. \n\n  \n\nStart by preparing a personalized presentation highlighting how your product or service addresses the specific challenges and pain points discussed during the discovery call. \n\n  \n\nFor the best results: \n\n  \n\n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Use success stories and social proof**, such as case studies and testimonials, to demonstrate the tangible benefits and results your solution has provided to similar companies.\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Try to handle objections confidently and effectively**. Be prepared to address common concerns and questions and provide clear, concise responses that reinforce the value of your offering. \n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Listen and respond to objections**. Like in the discovery call, it's important to listen to the prospect's objections, understand their underlying concerns, and tailor your responses to alleviate those worries.\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Use visuals**, like slides, infographics, and videos, to make your points more compelling and easier to understand. \n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Encourage questions and discussions** throughout the presentation to keep the prospect interested and to address any issues in real-time.\n    \n      \n    \n\n  \n\nBy personalizing your pitch and confidently handling objections, you can ensure your presentation resonates with your prospects and moves them closer to a purchasing decision.\n\n  \n\n### **5\\. Negotiation and Closing the Deal**\n\nThis is the stage in the B2B outbound sales process where your sales skills really come into play. There's usually a bit of persuasion, negotiation, and lots of persistence. \n\n  \n\nIt's best to strive for win-win negotiations where both parties feel like they're gaining value. Make sure you clearly communicate the benefits of your solution and be prepared to discuss pricing, terms, and any potential adjustments. \n\n  \n![ava1](https://www.artisan.co/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.ctfassets.net%2Fkyprwggh4muz%2F167nzEBCI7bnBDxWnGTeXP%2F9a9e729db409ce953e1f701152752fb0%2Fb2b.webp&w=3840&q=75)\n\nIt's important to be flexible during this phase, but it's equally important to stand firm on the value your product or service provides. Be sure to outline clear next steps to keep the momentum going. Your prospects should always know how to move forward with the deal. \n\n  \n\nAfter reaching an agreement, it may seem like your job is done, but consistent follow-up is crucial at this phase. It's not uncommon for deals to die in the pipeline – even after the prospect has agreed to move forward. \n\n  \n\nRegularly check in to address any lingering concerns and keep the prospect engaged. Use follow-up calls, emails, or meetings to reinforce the benefits of your solution and keep the deal moving forward.\n\n  \n\n### **6\\. Building Relationships and Account Management**\n\nAfter closing the deal, the focus shifts to building a strong, long-term relationship with the client, which starts with a smooth onboarding experience.  \n\n  \n\nOnce your client has signed the dotted line, be sure to guide them through the initial steps of using your product or service and point them to any other people they need to be aware of (i.e., account managers, customer support staff, etc.)\n\n  \n\nThis stage may be more of an account manager or customer success function. Regardless, someone in your company needs to:  \n\n  \n\n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Schedule periodic check-ins** to discuss the client's progress, address any issues, and gather feedback.\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Identify opportunities to upsell or cross-sell** additional products or services that can provide further value to the client.   \n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Quickly resolve issues** and be responsive to their questions to strengthen their loyalty and ensure a positive experience. \n    \n      \n    \n\n  \n\nHappy clients are more likely to become repeat customers and refer your business to others. Who doesn't want that? \n\n  \n\n**Optimize Your B2B Outbound Sales Strategy With AI** \n------------------------------------------------------\n\nOutbound sales is an important function for almost every thriving B2B organization. It's an effective strategy for reaching prospects, getting quick results, and growing your organization. \n\n  \n\nHowever, it's not a walk in the park. Being good at B2B outbound sales requires you to be skilled at things like overcoming rejection, identifying the right decision-makers, crafting compelling pitches, and more. \n\n  \n\nIt's a lot to balance. However, AI SDRs can address many of these challenges and streamline the pain points of outbound sales tremendously. \n\n  \n![Automate](https://www.artisan.co/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.ctfassets.net%2Fkyprwggh4muz%2F5nd40Fv7djsc8vGSWYzxMy%2Fd17616e3c3848bd69cda652cf590dc82%2FAutomate.webp&w=3840&q=75)\n\nFor example, [Ava, Artisan's AI SDR](https://www.artisan.co/ai-sales-agent)\n, can automate 80% of the sales process.

Successful founders and leaders know this mantra well and strive to instill it in their teams.\n\n  \n\nHowever, what should be a freeing feeling of narrowing your focus often adds an extra challenge for sales teams: _Which channels should you focus on?_\n\n  \n\nWith so many options for online and offline sales channels, it’s overwhelming to decide where to invest your time and resources. To help you make this decision, we’ve reviewed eleven channels that have the highest potential for B2B sales teams. \n\n  \n\nThe Importance of Choosing the Right B2B Sales Channels\n-------------------------------------------------------\n\n_Cold outreach or digital advertising? Conferences or email marketing?_ Choosing the right sales channels isn’t just about maximizing ROI; it may actually define your company’s long-term success. Here’s how.\n\n  \n![Importance of Choosing](https://www.artisan.co/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.ctfassets.net%2Fkyprwggh4muz%2F1e0JTitDiWOzDPl4Ixgd5I%2F8e1d91637c74d989b454e69fbfa03b32%2FImportance_of_Choosing.webp&w=3840&q=75)\n\n### Building Awareness With the Right Audience\n\nThe buyer’s journey is never linear, especially in B2B. Often, the sales process begins long before a customer responds to your first sales email. \n\n  \n\nIt starts when they first discover your company and remember the information. This could be through a cold outreach message they never replied to, a social media ad, or your speech at an industry conference. If the channel is right and puts you in front of **the right audience,** it will boost your sales performance in the long term.\n\n  \n\n### _Efficient_ Lead Generation and Sales Growth\n\nChoosing the right sales channels will inevitably help you grow faster and scale more easily. You won’t have to spend hours convincing irrelevant leads that your solution is right for them _(when it’s not)_.\n\n  \n\nSay, you might drive tons of leads with a social media ad offering freemium access to your enterprise-level solution. Thousands in ad spend and hundreds of sales team hours—only to get a handful of prospects that convert into paying customers. But if you focused your resources on outbound sales, you could generate fewer but more qualified leads and achieve higher conversion rates.\n\n  \n\n### Personalized Interactions With Potential Customers\n\nYour sales channels should help you build rapport with your prospects.\n\n  \n\nSome channels, such as social selling or cold outreach, provide a direct means to interact with customers. Others, like webinars and blogs, offer a platform to foster a sense of connection with your audience. Whichever you choose, these platforms are where you can build trust with potential customers and make an impression before diving into sales calls.\n\n  \n\n### Better Understanding of Your Target Audience\n\nYou may not discover the right sales channel on your first attempt. However, you will gain a deeper understanding of your ideal customers.\n\n  \n\nEach channel allows you to gather insights about your target audience: their preferences, online behavior, and what influences their decisions. Plus, many channels provide useful data and analytics, giving you deeper insights into their behaviors.\n\n  \n\nWith this data, you can identify what works best and optimize not only sales but your entire business strategy for maximum impact.\n\n  \n\n11 Effective B2B Sales Channels You Should Explore\n--------------------------------------------------\n\nSo yes, choosing the right B2B sales channel goes beyond reaching your sales KPIs. It's your chance to build an engine that connects your brand with the right audience and fosters long-term relationships for the future.\n\n  \n![11 Effective B2B Sales Channels You Should Explore-3](https://www.artisan.co/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.ctfassets.net%2Fkyprwggh4muz%2F65tVoUSKg4UtKSeZL4ai8x%2F4f8ef9413d413c8db51e586ed43eb4c9%2F11_Effective_B2B_Sales_Channels_You_Should_Explore-3.webp&w=3840&q=75)\n\nWith that in mind, let’s walk you through the top channels you should consider for your sales strategy.\n\n  \n\n### 1\\. Direct Sales and Cold Outreach\n\nWhat if, instead of spending your budget on a scattershot approach _(sorry, inbound sales)_, you invested it in reaching your exact audience?\n\n  \n\nThis “channel” has been here for ages. Ever since early humans started to exchange food for other valuable resources, humanity has been hooked on direct sales.\n\n  \n\nThe approach has remained largely unchanged **until AI revolutionized it**. Not long ago, an SDR had to spend hours identifying and prioritizing potential customers, carefully crafting and sending outreach messages. Today, things are different.\n\n  \n\nOutbound sales, a.k.a. direct sales, is no longer the most resource-intensive task for your sales team. AI-powered outbound sales software has made this channel more accessible to everyone—you don’t need a large SDR team to make it work anymore.\n\n  \n\n**How does it work?** AI SDRs take over the lead research and cold outreach processes, handing over qualified leads to your pipeline. All you need is a strong understanding of customer personas—AI SDRs will do the rest.\n\n  \n![Ava](https://www.artisan.co/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.ctfassets.net%2Fkyprwggh4muz%2F3IBg1NSqkcy4Edrp68dMqS%2Fa6ed9bdf949f4ddfbf26eb210790ffb1%2FAva.png&w=3840&q=75)\n\nFor instance, Artisan’s SDR Ava learns about your ideal customer profile (ICP), searches her database of over 300 million contacts in over 200 countries, and creates an outreach campaign to reach the top-matching prospects with highly personalized messages.\n\n  \n\n**The result?** Ava automates 80% of the outbound sales process. She allows you to build a scalable direct selling machine on autopilot—all without increasing overhead. [Try Ava today](https://www.artisan.co/ai-sales-agent)\n.\n\n  \n\nOur verdict is that direct selling and cold outreach are a must-have channel for B2B businesses. Whether you combine it with inbound sales techniques or not, it should be the core of your sales strategy.\n\n  \n\n### 2\\. Social Sales on LinkedIn\n\nLinkedIn is a powerhouse for B2B social selling. As this channel doesn’t need long introductions, let’s dive into how you can effectively integrate it into your sales strategy.\n\n  \n\nThere are many ways to sell on LinkedIn, both outbound and inbound. They include:\n\n  \n\n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Manual lead generation:** identifying leads based on criteria like job title, company size, and industry, then initiating contact through personalized messages on the platform.\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **LinkedIn Sales Navigator:** using LinkedIn’s premium tool to access advanced audience filters and automate lead tracking.\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Brand building:** developing a strong personal or company brand on LinkedIn through strategic marketing efforts to build trust with potential customers and attract inbound leads.\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **AI-powered automation:** employing automation tools like [Artisan](https://www.artisan.co/products/sales-automation)\n     or Apollo to discover and export qualified leads from LinkedIn and start cold outreach via email.\n    \n      \n    \n\n![LinkedIn (1)](https://www.artisan.co/blog/1)\n\nBut before jumping in, ensure your audience is active on LinkedIn. While it's particularly popular in the tech sphere, other industries are often less represented on the platform.\n\n  \n\n### 3\\. Conferences and Networking Events\n\nDirect selling allows you to connect with your prospects face-to-face, and so do offline events. \n\n  \n\nAttending trade shows and industry conferences, whether as a speaker, exhibitor, or attendee, is a great strategy for promoting your brand and starting to sell your products or services with minimal investment.\n\n  \n\nHere’s how you can find relevant events in your niche and turn them into your sales channel:\n\n  \n\n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Follow top voices in your industry on social media platforms (LinkedIn is a good place to start).** Check their feeds for the past year to see where they have been speaking—these events are likely to recur soon.\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Focus on small-scale events.** However enticing a major conference like Web Summit might sound, you’ll find more success at niche meetups.\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Sign up as an attendee first.** You’ll have the opportunity to connect with other participants and discuss business directly, without the pressure of preparing and delivering a speech.\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Research other attendees.** If the event page displays who’ll be present at the event (also common on LinkedIn), look into the attendees’ profiles to identify your potential buyers in advance.\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Prepare an elevator pitch.** Be ready to present the most important information about your business in about 30 seconds when people ask what you do.\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Have the helpful resources at hand.** Ensure you have easy access to all the links or contact information you might need to share.\n    \n      \n    \n\n![Networking](https://www.artisan.co/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.ctfassets.net%2Fkyprwggh4muz%2F1Rqi6m7fBSriqHMgA3dpft%2F7f8e9f499d0883b05c1102064513a43d%2FNetworking.webp&w=3840&q=75)\n\nAnd remember that, unlike typical outbound sales, promoting your company at networking events requires a more subtle approach. _Avoid greeting people with a direct sales pitch._\n\n  \n\n**Note:** This approach makes sense if you sell high-ticket products or services. If you sell basic subscription-based software, applying as a speaker will bring you much more exposure and potential leads.\n\n  \n\n### 4. Webinars and Online Industry Events\n\n[Seventy-seven percent of surveyed marketers](https://corp.kaltura.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/The-State-of-virtual-events-2024.pdf)\n say virtual events have a more positive impact on lead generation than in-person events. Of course, this is only true when you run your own event or join one as a co-host or sponsor.\n\n  \n\nIf you aim to generate qualified leads at scale, webinars and podcasts are the way to go. \n\n  \n\nHere are a few tips to plan a virtual event as a lead capture initiative:\n\n  \n\n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    Understand who you want to reach. Be specific.\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    Develop an agenda that is both relevant to your target market and aligned with your value proposition.\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    Select a reliable platform that supports interactive features like Q&A, polls, and chat to engage your audience.\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    Build a landing page with a lead capture form.\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    Use email marketing, social media, and your website to spread the word and encourage registrations.\n    \n      \n    \n\n  \n\nThat being said, webinars as a demand and lead generation tool don’t work for everyone. If you lack the resources to develop high-quality content, engage subject matter experts, and run a promotional campaign, it will simply become another hyped-up channel in your arsenal that fails to deliver the desired results.\n\n  \n\n### 5. SEO and Content Marketing\n\nKnown as digital marketing tactics in the first place, search engine optimization (SEO) and content marketing are also the primary channels to drive inbound leads. \n\n  \n\n[Ninety-six percent of consumers](https://blog.hubspot.com/sales/hubspot-sales-strategy-report)\n research their options before talking to a sales rep. So, having a website should be a no-brainer for every business. However, there's a catch.\n\n  \n\nHere's the thing: just having a website and sprinkling it with keywords won't cut it. To get your website noticed in a competitive field, it takes months or even years of continuous effort to create, optimize, measure, and so on.\n\n  \n\nSo, before you invest your time and money into growing your company website, ask yourself:\n\n  \n\n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **How competitive is your industry?** Use an SEO tool to check the difficulty of your target keywords. If it's above 50%, you're in a tough crowd.\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Do you have the resources to hire an SEO expert or manage a team?**\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Are your competitors showing up in search results? If they're not, why not?**\n    \n      \n    \n\n![SEO](https://www.artisan.co/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.ctfassets.net%2Fkyprwggh4muz%2F61vRga5d3hI5TAYwZWr2Qk%2F9650a3351cd95136080a11fc6f651838%2FSEO.png&w=3840&q=75)\n\nIf your industry is highly competitive and you're ready to commit to the long haul, investing in SEO can pay off big time.\n\n  \n\nIn a less competitive niche, spending a few hours optimizing your site with relevant keywords and content can get you on the first page of search results within weeks. If it ends up driving qualified leads, you've successfully identified a valuable sales channel for your business. If not, there's no harm done.\n\n  \n\n### 6. Email Marketing\n\nEmail marketing is [the most implemented](https://info.sagefrog.com/2020-marketing-mix-report)\n marketing tactic and is also a highly effective sales channel.\n\n  \n\nThink of it as a consent-based form of cold outreach. Instead of cold-calling or sending unsolicited messages, email marketing reaches potential customers who have willingly signed up to receive communication from your brand.\n\n  \n\nIt’s often a natural next step after lead generation efforts where leads aren’t yet ready for direct sales pitches.\n\n  \n\nHere’s how you can make it work:\n\n  \n\n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Collaborate with the marketing team.** Work closely to align your marketing strategy with sales efforts.\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Build a quality email list.** Gather contacts through sign-ups, subscriptions, or opt-ins on your website and other channels.\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Segment your audience.** Group your subscribers based on demographics, interests, or behaviors.\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Craft compelling content.** Create engaging and relevant content, including promotions, educational resources, and product updates.\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Create email sequences.** Use email automation tools to set up workflows that will trigger relevant emails based on your rules. \n    \n      \n    \n\n  \n\nThe part where you align with your marketing department is particularly important for the success of this campaign. Whether you let them handle it or you work together on every step, your alignment will help turn potential leads into actual sales faster.\n\n  \n\n### 7. Online Advertising\n\nNeed to gain traction fast? Paid media is [a top choice](https://www.gartner.com/en/digital-markets/insights/paid-marketing-channels)\n among SaaS businesses. \n\n  \n![top channels](https://www.artisan.co/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.ctfassets.net%2Fkyprwggh4muz%2F2FyMQcEfpJpFv9MlQnlHfU%2F89b763eadcee125bf11e46bc48f178fa%2Ftop_channels.png&w=3840&q=75)\n\nBut which platform should you choose: LinkedIn, Facebook, Google, or another channel? The answer to this question lies in understanding your audience.\n\n  \n\nFor instance, GoogleAds are perfect for a B2B brand looking to capture prospects **actively searching for solutions or services.** It’s like using a shortcut to SEO—your landing pages will appear at the top of search results when people are searching for relevant keywords.\n\n  \n\nIf your sales strategy requires creating awareness first, channels like LinkedIn or Facebook are better choices. Now, the decision hinges on whether your audience is active on these platforms and your budget _(note that LinkedIn Ads are more expensive)_.\n\n  \n\n### 8. Affiliate Programs \n\nWhether you already have an extensive customer base or not, an affiliate program is a way to accelerate new customer acquisition.\n\n  \n\nAn affiliate program, also known as a referral program, lets you promote and sell your products or services through your loyal customers and partners—or anyone willing to earn a commission on a sale.\n\n  \n\nWhile it does involve sharing a small part of your profit _(usually 2% to 15%, depending on your offer's cost)_ with a third party, it’s one of the least resource-intensive sales channels. In some cases, especially where sales depend on word of mouth, it’s also the most cost-effective strategy.\n\n  \n\nYou can either self-host your affiliate program, tracking sales and managing payouts yourself, or use a third-party affiliate platform to host your program. Using a third-party platform requires minimal effort to set up the program and partner conditions, and it handles tracking and managing the program for you.\n\n  \n\nThe best part is that affiliate platforms often include an online marketplace where potential partners can find you.\n\n  \n\n### 9. Trade Shows\n\nExhibiting your product or service at trade shows is a great way to raise awareness and engage in meaningful face-to-face conversations with your prospects. It’s actually one of the [top three marketing investment](https://info.sagefrog.com/2020-marketing-mix-report)\n priorities for B2B companies. \n\n  \n\nIn the B2B world, these shows are often part of major conferences. They attract attendees who are exploring offerings without much purchase intent. This makes trade shows especially effective for entering new markets.\n\n  \n\n### 10\\. E-Commerce Channels\n\nDo you sell physical products to B2B customers? You can increase your reach and drive sales with the following e-commerce channels: \n\n  \n\n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Wholesale B2B platforms.** Platforms like Alibaba connect business-to-business (B2B) suppliers and distributors looking to invest in wholesale products. \n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Niche-specific marketplaces.** Distribution channels like ThomasNet offer a more narrow focus and are designed for procurement professionals in specific categories.\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **General e-commerce platforms.** You can create your own online storefront with platforms like Shopify and BigCommerce. They offer dedicated functionality to build buyer portals, manage invoicing, process payments, and other critical features for B2B sellers.\n    \n      \n    \n\n![E-commerce](https://www.artisan.co/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.ctfassets.net%2Fkyprwggh4muz%2F6nmd3c8PLvXyKHBans0BNb%2F8f895bf6c4f3cdc08fcda38a0de1d076%2FE-commerce.webp&w=3840&q=75)\n\n### 11\\. Partnering With Consulting and Professional Services\n\nMaybe you don’t need thousands of customers. Perhaps you only need a few large clients who deliver services to their own customers and need your product to do it effectively.\n\n  \n\nHere’s how to use partnerships to grow your business:\n\n  \n\n1.  ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Look for large agencies and established consultants in your niche.** Search LinkedIn and industry marketplaces to find potential partners.\n    \n      \n    \n2.  ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Research their tech stacks.** Find a point of contact within the organization and understand their current pain points with the solutions they use.\n    \n      \n    \n3.  ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Create special discounts or pricing plans for these partners.** The potential business they bring in will far outweigh the cost of these discounts.\n    \n      \n    \n4.  ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Be ready to support them extensively.** Large clients may require custom solutions and account management. _Are you ready for it?_\n    \n      \n    \n\n  \n\nAnother way to use partnerships to drive sales is by having them resell your product. If your product complements their services, they might be interested in selling it to their customers.\n\n  \n\nFor instance, if you offer CRM software for jewelry brands, a jewelry marketing agency might want to transition their clients from legacy systems to your more user-friendly option.\n\n  \n\nChoosing the Right B2B Sales Channels for Your Business\n-------------------------------------------------------\n\nHaven’t decided yet which of these channels will fit your strategy best? This process will help you make an informed decision: \n\n  \n![Strategy ](https://www.artisan.co/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.ctfassets.net%2Fkyprwggh4muz%2F4bzaLpzbR5f9Hf8ja55y6a%2F4a771a5ce6aa5bd7963a48b1664a913e%2FStrategdy.webp&w=3840&q=75)\n\n### 1\\. Map Out Your Buyer’s Journey\n\nThe buyer journey is your prospects’ path to purchase. Your task is to put the “traffic signs” at the right points to direct them toward the shortest path.\n\n  \n\nYou likely have several customer personas, each with distinct buyer journeys. Follow this process to map out the buyer’s journey for each persona:\n\n  \n\n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    Understand the role of your persona in the company. _Are they an influencer, user, or decision-maker?_\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    Determine where each persona enters your sales funnel. _Are they actively searching for a solution, or do you need to build problem awareness?_\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    Outline all interactions potential clients have with your brand, from initial contact to purchase and beyond. _Which interactions should be handled by the sales team?_\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    Break down the journey into stages such as awareness, consideration, decision, and post-purchase. _What stage does each touchpoint correspond to?_\n    \n      \n    \n\n  \n\nYou’ve just created a basic buyer’s journey map. If you already have historical data at hand, this process will be even smoother.\n\n  \n\n### 2\\. See What Similar Businesses Are Doing for Sales\n\nYou know your customers; now you need to know your close competitors.\n\n  \n\n_Are they actively building their presence on LinkedIn? Are they investing in paid ads? Are they participating in trade shows?_\n\n  \n\nTake note of their strategies and consider trying them yourself. If these methods work for your competitors, they will likely work for you too.\n\n  \n\n### 3\\. Evaluate the Channel’s Potential for Your Goals\n\nWell, you can't do everything your competitors do at once. You need to prioritize your initiatives. \n\n  \n\n_But how?_ Here’s the answer:\n\n  \n\n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    Be specific with your current objectives. _Are you building brand awareness, generating qualified leads, or increasing high-ticket sales?_\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    Turn to your buyer’s journey. _Which sales channels align with your business goals and drive prospects along the shortest path to achieving them?_\n    \n      \n    \n\n  \n\nFocus on what drives the biggest impact on your goals at the moment. \n\n  \n\n### 4\\. Continue to Analyze and Optimize\n\nAs you implement your chosen channels, you’ll likely uncover discrepancies between your hypotheses and reality—and that's okay.\n\n  \n\nWhat's not okay is sticking with channels that aren't delivering results. Monitor your performance metrics and don’t hesitate to adjust your approaches or stop using the channels that show no positive results within a few months.\n\n  \n\n### 5\\. Unlock the Full Potential of Your Sales Channels With AI\n\nLike it or not, your competition is already implementing AI into their workflows. \n\n  \n\nIn fact, as many as [63% of sales leaders](https://blog.hubspot.com/sales/hubspot-sales-strategy-report)\n say AI helps them stay competitive in their industry. AI allows you to maximize the potential of your sales team _and_ offer more personalized customer experiences—no wonder it’s a priority for most sales teams.\n\n  \n\nHere are some ideas for how you can augment your sales channels with AI:\n\n  \n\n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    Hire AI SDRs to hand over cold outreach and generate _more qualified leads, faster._ [Try Ava now](https://www.artisan.co/ai-sales-agent)\n    .\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    Use AI features built into your CRM system.

Successful founders and leaders know this mantra well and strive to instill it in their teams.\n\n  \n\nHowever, what should be a freeing feeling of narrowing your focus often adds an extra challenge for sales teams: _Which channels should you focus on?_\n\n  \n\nWith so many options for online and offline sales channels, it’s overwhelming to decide where to invest your time and resources. To help you make this decision, we’ve reviewed eleven channels that have the highest potential for B2B sales teams. \n\n  \n\nThe Importance of Choosing the Right B2B Sales Channels\n-------------------------------------------------------\n\n_Cold outreach or digital advertising? Conferences or email marketing?_ Choosing the right sales channels isn’t just about maximizing ROI; it may actually define your company’s long-term success. Here’s how.\n\n  \n![Importance of Choosing](https://www.artisan.co/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.ctfassets.net%2Fkyprwggh4muz%2F1e0JTitDiWOzDPl4Ixgd5I%2F8e1d91637c74d989b454e69fbfa03b32%2FImportance_of_Choosing.webp&w=3840&q=75)\n\n### Building Awareness With the Right Audience\n\nThe buyer’s journey is never linear, especially in B2B. Often, the sales process begins long before a customer responds to your first sales email. \n\n  \n\nIt starts when they first discover your company and remember the information. This could be through a cold outreach message they never replied to, a social media ad, or your speech at an industry conference. If the channel is right and puts you in front of **the right audience,** it will boost your sales performance in the long term.\n\n  \n\n### _Efficient_ Lead Generation and Sales Growth\n\nChoosing the right sales channels will inevitably help you grow faster and scale more easily. You won’t have to spend hours convincing irrelevant leads that your solution is right for them _(when it’s not)_.\n\n  \n\nSay, you might drive tons of leads with a social media ad offering freemium access to your enterprise-level solution. Thousands in ad spend and hundreds of sales team hours—only to get a handful of prospects that convert into paying customers. But if you focused your resources on outbound sales, you could generate fewer but more qualified leads and achieve higher conversion rates.\n\n  \n\n### Personalized Interactions With Potential Customers\n\nYour sales channels should help you build rapport with your prospects.\n\n  \n\nSome channels, such as social selling or cold outreach, provide a direct means to interact with customers. Others, like webinars and blogs, offer a platform to foster a sense of connection with your audience. Whichever you choose, these platforms are where you can build trust with potential customers and make an impression before diving into sales calls.\n\n  \n\n### Better Understanding of Your Target Audience\n\nYou may not discover the right sales channel on your first attempt. However, you will gain a deeper understanding of your ideal customers.\n\n  \n\nEach channel allows you to gather insights about your target audience: their preferences, online behavior, and what influences their decisions. Plus, many channels provide useful data and analytics, giving you deeper insights into their behaviors.\n\n  \n\nWith this data, you can identify what works best and optimize not only sales but your entire business strategy for maximum impact.\n\n  \n\n11 Effective B2B Sales Channels You Should Explore\n--------------------------------------------------\n\nSo yes, choosing the right B2B sales channel goes beyond reaching your sales KPIs. It's your chance to build an engine that connects your brand with the right audience and fosters long-term relationships for the future.\n\n  \n![11 Effective B2B Sales Channels You Should Explore-3](https://www.artisan.co/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.ctfassets.net%2Fkyprwggh4muz%2F65tVoUSKg4UtKSeZL4ai8x%2F4f8ef9413d413c8db51e586ed43eb4c9%2F11_Effective_B2B_Sales_Channels_You_Should_Explore-3.webp&w=3840&q=75)\n\nWith that in mind, let’s walk you through the top channels you should consider for your sales strategy.\n\n  \n\n### 1\\. Direct Sales and Cold Outreach\n\nWhat if, instead of spending your budget on a scattershot approach _(sorry, inbound sales)_, you invested it in reaching your exact audience?\n\n  \n\nThis “channel” has been here for ages. Ever since early humans started to exchange food for other valuable resources, humanity has been hooked on direct sales.\n\n  \n\nThe approach has remained largely unchanged **until AI revolutionized it**. Not long ago, an SDR had to spend hours identifying and prioritizing potential customers, carefully crafting and sending outreach messages. Today, things are different.\n\n  \n\nOutbound sales, a.k.a. direct sales, is no longer the most resource-intensive task for your sales team. AI-powered outbound sales software has made this channel more accessible to everyone—you don’t need a large SDR team to make it work anymore.\n\n  \n\n**How does it work?** AI SDRs take over the lead research and cold outreach processes, handing over qualified leads to your pipeline. All you need is a strong understanding of customer personas—AI SDRs will do the rest.\n\n  \n![Ava](https://www.artisan.co/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.ctfassets.net%2Fkyprwggh4muz%2F3IBg1NSqkcy4Edrp68dMqS%2Fa6ed9bdf949f4ddfbf26eb210790ffb1%2FAva.png&w=3840&q=75)\n\nFor instance, Artisan’s SDR Ava learns about your ideal customer profile (ICP), searches her database of over 300 million contacts in over 200 countries, and creates an outreach campaign to reach the top-matching prospects with highly personalized messages.\n\n  \n\n**The result?** Ava automates 80% of the outbound sales process. She allows you to build a scalable direct selling machine on autopilot—all without increasing overhead. [Try Ava today](https://www.artisan.co/ai-sales-agent)\n.\n\n  \n\nOur verdict is that direct selling and cold outreach are a must-have channel for B2B businesses. Whether you combine it with inbound sales techniques or not, it should be the core of your sales strategy.\n\n  \n\n### 2\\. Social Sales on LinkedIn\n\nLinkedIn is a powerhouse for B2B social selling. As this channel doesn’t need long introductions, let’s dive into how you can effectively integrate it into your sales strategy.\n\n  \n\nThere are many ways to sell on LinkedIn, both outbound and inbound. They include:\n\n  \n\n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Manual lead generation:** identifying leads based on criteria like job title, company size, and industry, then initiating contact through personalized messages on the platform.\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **LinkedIn Sales Navigator:** using LinkedIn’s premium tool to access advanced audience filters and automate lead tracking.\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Brand building:** developing a strong personal or company brand on LinkedIn through strategic marketing efforts to build trust with potential customers and attract inbound leads.\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **AI-powered automation:** employing automation tools like [Artisan](https://www.artisan.co/products/sales-automation)\n     or Apollo to discover and export qualified leads from LinkedIn and start cold outreach via email.\n    \n      \n    \n\n![LinkedIn (1)](https://www.artisan.co/blog/1)\n\nBut before jumping in, ensure your audience is active on LinkedIn. While it's particularly popular in the tech sphere, other industries are often less represented on the platform.\n\n  \n\n### 3\\. Conferences and Networking Events\n\nDirect selling allows you to connect with your prospects face-to-face, and so do offline events. \n\n  \n\nAttending trade shows and industry conferences, whether as a speaker, exhibitor, or attendee, is a great strategy for promoting your brand and starting to sell your products or services with minimal investment.\n\n  \n\nHere’s how you can find relevant events in your niche and turn them into your sales channel:\n\n  \n\n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Follow top voices in your industry on social media platforms (LinkedIn is a good place to start).** Check their feeds for the past year to see where they have been speaking—these events are likely to recur soon.\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Focus on small-scale events.** However enticing a major conference like Web Summit might sound, you’ll find more success at niche meetups.\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Sign up as an attendee first.** You’ll have the opportunity to connect with other participants and discuss business directly, without the pressure of preparing and delivering a speech.\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Research other attendees.** If the event page displays who’ll be present at the event (also common on LinkedIn), look into the attendees’ profiles to identify your potential buyers in advance.\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Prepare an elevator pitch.** Be ready to present the most important information about your business in about 30 seconds when people ask what you do.\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Have the helpful resources at hand.** Ensure you have easy access to all the links or contact information you might need to share.\n    \n      \n    \n\n![Networking](https://www.artisan.co/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.ctfassets.net%2Fkyprwggh4muz%2F1Rqi6m7fBSriqHMgA3dpft%2F7f8e9f499d0883b05c1102064513a43d%2FNetworking.webp&w=3840&q=75)\n\nAnd remember that, unlike typical outbound sales, promoting your company at networking events requires a more subtle approach. _Avoid greeting people with a direct sales pitch._\n\n  \n\n**Note:** This approach makes sense if you sell high-ticket products or services. If you sell basic subscription-based software, applying as a speaker will bring you much more exposure and potential leads.\n\n  \n\n### 4. Webinars and Online Industry Events\n\n[Seventy-seven percent of surveyed marketers](https://corp.kaltura.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/The-State-of-virtual-events-2024.pdf)\n say virtual events have a more positive impact on lead generation than in-person events. Of course, this is only true when you run your own event or join one as a co-host or sponsor.\n\n  \n\nIf you aim to generate qualified leads at scale, webinars and podcasts are the way to go. \n\n  \n\nHere are a few tips to plan a virtual event as a lead capture initiative:\n\n  \n\n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    Understand who you want to reach. Be specific.\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    Develop an agenda that is both relevant to your target market and aligned with your value proposition.\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    Select a reliable platform that supports interactive features like Q&A, polls, and chat to engage your audience.\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    Build a landing page with a lead capture form.\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    Use email marketing, social media, and your website to spread the word and encourage registrations.\n    \n      \n    \n\n  \n\nThat being said, webinars as a demand and lead generation tool don’t work for everyone. If you lack the resources to develop high-quality content, engage subject matter experts, and run a promotional campaign, it will simply become another hyped-up channel in your arsenal that fails to deliver the desired results.\n\n  \n\n### 5. SEO and Content Marketing\n\nKnown as digital marketing tactics in the first place, search engine optimization (SEO) and content marketing are also the primary channels to drive inbound leads. \n\n  \n\n[Ninety-six percent of consumers](https://blog.hubspot.com/sales/hubspot-sales-strategy-report)\n research their options before talking to a sales rep. So, having a website should be a no-brainer for every business. However, there's a catch.\n\n  \n\nHere's the thing: just having a website and sprinkling it with keywords won't cut it. To get your website noticed in a competitive field, it takes months or even years of continuous effort to create, optimize, measure, and so on.\n\n  \n\nSo, before you invest your time and money into growing your company website, ask yourself:\n\n  \n\n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **How competitive is your industry?** Use an SEO tool to check the difficulty of your target keywords. If it's above 50%, you're in a tough crowd.\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Do you have the resources to hire an SEO expert or manage a team?**\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Are your competitors showing up in search results? If they're not, why not?**\n    \n      \n    \n\n![SEO](https://www.artisan.co/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.ctfassets.net%2Fkyprwggh4muz%2F61vRga5d3hI5TAYwZWr2Qk%2F9650a3351cd95136080a11fc6f651838%2FSEO.png&w=3840&q=75)\n\nIf your industry is highly competitive and you're ready to commit to the long haul, investing in SEO can pay off big time.\n\n  \n\nIn a less competitive niche, spending a few hours optimizing your site with relevant keywords and content can get you on the first page of search results within weeks. If it ends up driving qualified leads, you've successfully identified a valuable sales channel for your business. If not, there's no harm done.\n\n  \n\n### 6. Email Marketing\n\nEmail marketing is [the most implemented](https://info.sagefrog.com/2020-marketing-mix-report)\n marketing tactic and is also a highly effective sales channel.\n\n  \n\nThink of it as a consent-based form of cold outreach. Instead of cold-calling or sending unsolicited messages, email marketing reaches potential customers who have willingly signed up to receive communication from your brand.\n\n  \n\nIt’s often a natural next step after lead generation efforts where leads aren’t yet ready for direct sales pitches.\n\n  \n\nHere’s how you can make it work:\n\n  \n\n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Collaborate with the marketing team.** Work closely to align your marketing strategy with sales efforts.\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Build a quality email list.** Gather contacts through sign-ups, subscriptions, or opt-ins on your website and other channels.\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Segment your audience.** Group your subscribers based on demographics, interests, or behaviors.\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Craft compelling content.** Create engaging and relevant content, including promotions, educational resources, and product updates.\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Create email sequences.** Use email automation tools to set up workflows that will trigger relevant emails based on your rules. \n    \n      \n    \n\n  \n\nThe part where you align with your marketing department is particularly important for the success of this campaign. Whether you let them handle it or you work together on every step, your alignment will help turn potential leads into actual sales faster.\n\n  \n\n### 7. Online Advertising\n\nNeed to gain traction fast? Paid media is [a top choice](https://www.gartner.com/en/digital-markets/insights/paid-marketing-channels)\n among SaaS businesses. \n\n  \n![top channels](https://www.artisan.co/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.ctfassets.net%2Fkyprwggh4muz%2F2FyMQcEfpJpFv9MlQnlHfU%2F89b763eadcee125bf11e46bc48f178fa%2Ftop_channels.png&w=3840&q=75)\n\nBut which platform should you choose: LinkedIn, Facebook, Google, or another channel? The answer to this question lies in understanding your audience.\n\n  \n\nFor instance, GoogleAds are perfect for a B2B brand looking to capture prospects **actively searching for solutions or services.** It’s like using a shortcut to SEO—your landing pages will appear at the top of search results when people are searching for relevant keywords.\n\n  \n\nIf your sales strategy requires creating awareness first, channels like LinkedIn or Facebook are better choices. Now, the decision hinges on whether your audience is active on these platforms and your budget _(note that LinkedIn Ads are more expensive)_.\n\n  \n\n### 8. Affiliate Programs \n\nWhether you already have an extensive customer base or not, an affiliate program is a way to accelerate new customer acquisition.\n\n  \n\nAn affiliate program, also known as a referral program, lets you promote and sell your products or services through your loyal customers and partners—or anyone willing to earn a commission on a sale.\n\n  \n\nWhile it does involve sharing a small part of your profit _(usually 2% to 15%, depending on your offer's cost)_ with a third party, it’s one of the least resource-intensive sales channels. In some cases, especially where sales depend on word of mouth, it’s also the most cost-effective strategy.\n\n  \n\nYou can either self-host your affiliate program, tracking sales and managing payouts yourself, or use a third-party affiliate platform to host your program. Using a third-party platform requires minimal effort to set up the program and partner conditions, and it handles tracking and managing the program for you.\n\n  \n\nThe best part is that affiliate platforms often include an online marketplace where potential partners can find you.\n\n  \n\n### 9. Trade Shows\n\nExhibiting your product or service at trade shows is a great way to raise awareness and engage in meaningful face-to-face conversations with your prospects. It’s actually one of the [top three marketing investment](https://info.sagefrog.com/2020-marketing-mix-report)\n priorities for B2B companies. \n\n  \n\nIn the B2B world, these shows are often part of major conferences. They attract attendees who are exploring offerings without much purchase intent. This makes trade shows especially effective for entering new markets.\n\n  \n\n### 10\\. E-Commerce Channels\n\nDo you sell physical products to B2B customers? You can increase your reach and drive sales with the following e-commerce channels: \n\n  \n\n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Wholesale B2B platforms.** Platforms like Alibaba connect business-to-business (B2B) suppliers and distributors looking to invest in wholesale products. \n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Niche-specific marketplaces.** Distribution channels like ThomasNet offer a more narrow focus and are designed for procurement professionals in specific categories.\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **General e-commerce platforms.** You can create your own online storefront with platforms like Shopify and BigCommerce. They offer dedicated functionality to build buyer portals, manage invoicing, process payments, and other critical features for B2B sellers.\n    \n      \n    \n\n![E-commerce](https://www.artisan.co/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.ctfassets.net%2Fkyprwggh4muz%2F6nmd3c8PLvXyKHBans0BNb%2F8f895bf6c4f3cdc08fcda38a0de1d076%2FE-commerce.webp&w=3840&q=75)\n\n### 11\\. Partnering With Consulting and Professional Services\n\nMaybe you don’t need thousands of customers. Perhaps you only need a few large clients who deliver services to their own customers and need your product to do it effectively.\n\n  \n\nHere’s how to use partnerships to grow your business:\n\n  \n\n1.  ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Look for large agencies and established consultants in your niche.** Search LinkedIn and industry marketplaces to find potential partners.\n    \n      \n    \n2.  ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Research their tech stacks.** Find a point of contact within the organization and understand their current pain points with the solutions they use.\n    \n      \n    \n3.  ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Create special discounts or pricing plans for these partners.** The potential business they bring in will far outweigh the cost of these discounts.\n    \n      \n    \n4.  ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Be ready to support them extensively.** Large clients may require custom solutions and account management. _Are you ready for it?_\n    \n      \n    \n\n  \n\nAnother way to use partnerships to drive sales is by having them resell your product. If your product complements their services, they might be interested in selling it to their customers.\n\n  \n\nFor instance, if you offer CRM software for jewelry brands, a jewelry marketing agency might want to transition their clients from legacy systems to your more user-friendly option.\n\n  \n\nChoosing the Right B2B Sales Channels for Your Business\n-------------------------------------------------------\n\nHaven’t decided yet which of these channels will fit your strategy best? This process will help you make an informed decision: \n\n  \n![Strategy ](https://www.artisan.co/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.ctfassets.net%2Fkyprwggh4muz%2F4bzaLpzbR5f9Hf8ja55y6a%2F4a771a5ce6aa5bd7963a48b1664a913e%2FStrategdy.webp&w=3840&q=75)\n\n### 1\\. Map Out Your Buyer’s Journey\n\nThe buyer journey is your prospects’ path to purchase. Your task is to put the “traffic signs” at the right points to direct them toward the shortest path.\n\n  \n\nYou likely have several customer personas, each with distinct buyer journeys. Follow this process to map out the buyer’s journey for each persona:\n\n  \n\n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    Understand the role of your persona in the company. _Are they an influencer, user, or decision-maker?_\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    Determine where each persona enters your sales funnel. _Are they actively searching for a solution, or do you need to build problem awareness?_\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    Outline all interactions potential clients have with your brand, from initial contact to purchase and beyond. _Which interactions should be handled by the sales team?_\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    Break down the journey into stages such as awareness, consideration, decision, and post-purchase. _What stage does each touchpoint correspond to?_\n    \n      \n    \n\n  \n\nYou’ve just created a basic buyer’s journey map. If you already have historical data at hand, this process will be even smoother.\n\n  \n\n### 2\\. See What Similar Businesses Are Doing for Sales\n\nYou know your customers; now you need to know your close competitors.\n\n  \n\n_Are they actively building their presence on LinkedIn? Are they investing in paid ads? Are they participating in trade shows?_\n\n  \n\nTake note of their strategies and consider trying them yourself. If these methods work for your competitors, they will likely work for you too.\n\n  \n\n### 3\\. Evaluate the Channel’s Potential for Your Goals\n\nWell, you can't do everything your competitors do at once. You need to prioritize your initiatives. \n\n  \n\n_But how?_ Here’s the answer:\n\n  \n\n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    Be specific with your current objectives. _Are you building brand awareness, generating qualified leads, or increasing high-ticket sales?_\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    Turn to your buyer’s journey. _Which sales channels align with your business goals and drive prospects along the shortest path to achieving them?_\n    \n      \n    \n\n  \n\nFocus on what drives the biggest impact on your goals at the moment. \n\n  \n\n### 4\\. Continue to Analyze and Optimize\n\nAs you implement your chosen channels, you’ll likely uncover discrepancies between your hypotheses and reality—and that's okay.\n\n  \n\nWhat's not okay is sticking with channels that aren't delivering results. Monitor your performance metrics and don’t hesitate to adjust your approaches or stop using the channels that show no positive results within a few months.\n\n  \n\n### 5\\. Unlock the Full Potential of Your Sales Channels With AI\n\nLike it or not, your competition is already implementing AI into their workflows. \n\n  \n\nIn fact, as many as [63% of sales leaders](https://blog.hubspot.com/sales/hubspot-sales-strategy-report)\n say AI helps them stay competitive in their industry.

Whether you’re a bootstrapped startup founder wearing multiple hats or a junior marketer at an international SaaS enterprise, your company’s very existence hinges on your ability to drive _consistent and high-quality_ leads. \n\n  \n\nLead gen will never be easy. But you can make it significantly less difficult by basing your strategy on the right mix of techniques and bolstering them with well-chosen tools.\n\n  \n\nIf you’re new to B2B lead generation, this guide will help you build your system from the ground up. If you’re a seasoned pro, you’ll find tips and suggestions to further refine and develop your approach. \n\n  \n\nSound good? To quote perhaps the most overused ChatGPTism, let’s “dive” in. \n\n  \n\nWhat Is B2B Lead Generation?\n----------------------------\n\n![Resarching Leads](https://www.artisan.co/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.ctfassets.net%2Fkyprwggh4muz%2F7HNApk4KdUyLPeX8oXTir5%2F8c280ca79198503c491690a3fe8ecf80%2FResarching_Leads.webp&w=3840&q=75)\n\nB2B lead generation is the process of identifying and engaging potential customers. Lead generation focuses on the initial awareness or “top of funnel” phase of the customer acquisition journey. \n\n  \n\nThere are several categories of leads. Marketing-qualified leads (MQLs) and sales-qualified leads (SQLs) are the most important. A marketing-qualified lead is a lead who has shown enough interest in your product or service—such as by responding to an ad or reaching out for more information—to be seen as having a reasonable likelihood of becoming a customer. \n\n  \n\nAt this stage, lead _generation_ ends and lead _nurturing_ begins. Lead nurturing is usually the responsibility of the sales team (although marketing teams may play a role alongside sales reps). A lead transitions from an MQL to an SQL when they have been through the nurturing process and are ready to buy. \n\n  \n\nLead generation is important because it’s the foundation of any successful sales funnel. It’s directly tied to baseline metrics like revenue, growth and profitability. B2B companies with effective lead generation strategies generate [133% more revenue](https://intellistart.co.uk/what-is-lead-generation-and-why-is-it-important/)\n compared to “average” companies that don’t fully engage potential buyers.\n\n  \n\nHow to Find B2B Leads That Boost Your Business\n----------------------------------------------\n\nWithout further ado, let’s look at the strategies themselves. Keep in mind that the idea isn’t to apply everything blindly. Rather, you should find the right _mix_ for your target audience and product. \n\n  \n\n### 1\\. Find B2B Leads via LinkedIn Sales Navigator \n\nLinkedIn has one of the most complete, most accurate B2B lead databases. [89% of B2B marketers](https://sproutsocial.com/insights/linkedin-statistics/)\n use LinkedIn for lead generation, and 62% say its effective over the long term.\n\n  \n![Resarching Leads-1](https://www.artisan.co/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.ctfassets.net%2Fkyprwggh4muz%2F2EosHwTyHHy77922dquhWw%2Fffbe25a3678b9597ab029d5df6be6230%2FResarching_Leads-1.webp&w=3840&q=75)\n\nHere’s how to generate leads with LinkedIn Sales Navigator. \n\n  \n\n1.  ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    Purchase a paid LinkedIn plan if you don’t already have one. \n    \n      \n    \n2.  ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    Use advanced search filters to target specific industries, company sizes, job titles, etc. based on your ideal customer profile (ICP). \n    \n      \n    \n3.  ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    Use LinkedIn's InMail feature to reach out directly to B2B prospects and decision-makers with a personalized message that clearly outlines your value proposition. \n    \n      \n    \n4.  ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    Follow up, again keeping everything personalized. \n    \n      \n    \n\n  \n\nHere’s a sample template based on the three Cs (compliment, case study, call to action) of successful outreach: \n\n  \n\n_Hi {prospect name},_\n\n  \n\n_Love what you’re doing at {prospect company name}. I was particularly impressed by your {recent prospect company achievement)._ \n\n  \n\n_At {your company name}, we provide {your service}. We recently helped one of our clients achieve {client result)._ \n\n  \n\n_We’d love to do the same for you. Are you free for a quick call this week?_ \n\n  \n\nAnd here’s what an example looks like in practice with Microsoft as an example:\n\n  \n\n_Hi Bill,_\n\n  \n\n_Love what you’re doing at Microsoft. I was particularly impressed by your latest VR headset release._ \n\n  \n\n_At Artisan, we provide fully automated, AI-driven lead gen. We recently helped one of our clients triple their VR sales._ \n\n  \n\n_We’d love to do the same for you. Are you free for a quick call this week?_ \n\n  \n\n### 2\\. Start a Customer Referral Program\n\nResearch shows that referral programs are among the most effective low-cost lead-gen strategies, with [86% of companies](https://viral-loops.com/referral-marketing/statistics)\n that use referral programs experiencing growth. \n\n  \n\nIf you don’t already have a referral program, you’re potentially missing out on Everest-size mountains of inexpensive leads. \n\n  \n\nHere’s how to launch a referral program:\n\n  \n\n1.  ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Decide on an attractive referral incentive.** Incentivize existing customers to refer new leads by offering discounts, rewards, or bonuses. Offer an incentive to _both_ the referrer and the recipient. \n    \n      \n    \n2.  ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Build referral infrastructure.** Create referral program landing pages and track referrals through your CRM. While there’s significant variability between industries, data shows that a referral rate (the percentage of your total sales that come from referrals) of [around 10%](https://www.alexanderjarvis.com/what-is-referral-rate-what-is-the-formula-and-why-it-is-important/)\n     is healthy. \n    \n      \n    \n3.  ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Contact existing customers.** Foster strong relationships with customers to encourage advocacy and referrals. Include referral emails in your email onboarding sequences and newsletter broadcasts.\n    \n      \n    \n4.  ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Test and refine.** You’re unlikely to create a perfect referral program right off the bat, and that’s OK. Continuous A/B testing of your incentives, landing pages, and email outreach ensures ongoing improvement. \n    \n      \n    \n\n![Referal](https://www.artisan.co/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.ctfassets.net%2Fkyprwggh4muz%2F4piiizGmNxKg2NVRNDaCjC%2Ffec690faa57c6620b576c550d287b7ef%2FReferal.webp&w=3840&q=75)\n\n### 3\\. Find and Reach Qualified Leads With AI Sales Tools\n\nAI sales tools streamline the process of finding and reaching qualified leads through automated lead scoring, data enrichment, personalized outreach, and hands-off optimization. \n\n  \n\nAI sales tools also allow salespeople to focus on high-value activities like pursuing the most promising potential leads, which is the key to improving conversion rates and, ultimately, revenue.\n\n  \n\nLet’s take the example of [Artisan](https://www.artisan.co/)\n, an advanced lead-gen AI tool, to see how you would prospect in this way:\n\n  \n\n1.  ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    Define your ICPs in detail to lay the basis for personalization and segmentation. \n    \n      \n    \n2.  ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    Create outreach templates, allowing AI to add a high level of lead personalization. \n    \n      \n    \n3.  ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    Let Artisan consult its lead database of over 300 million leads to put together a highly relevant list of targets. \n    \n      \n    \n4.  ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    Use AI-based insights to improve your response and conversion rates with ongoing outreach optimization and lead scoring.\n    \n      \n    \n\n  \n\nTools like Artisan are powerful for two main reasons. \n\n  \n\nFirst, they allow for a largely hands-off approach, with AI taking over many manual tasks such as outreach personalization and lead filtering. \n\n  \n\nSecond, they are excellent for scaling. The size of Artisan’s database and the unlimited capacity of its AI engine means you can ramp up your lead gen in a fraction of the time it might otherwise take. \n\n  \n![AI Help](https://www.artisan.co/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.ctfassets.net%2Fkyprwggh4muz%2F2ijTJTlQ9N3n4AVK7P9yhH%2F4d705d21ef00d41a2ecd4ca51b4f3415%2FAI_Help.webp&w=3840&q=75)\n\n**Ready to find perfect-fit B2B leads on autopilot?** Supercharge your sales with Ava, Artisan’s AI business development representative.

Engage Prospects Through Social Media\n\nLinkedIn is the [top platform for B2B](https://www.statista.com/statistics/1445198/leading-social-media-platforms-used-for-b2b-marketing/)\n marketing, with YouTube coming in second. Instagram, Facebook, and Twitter are also powerful, pointing towards the need for an omnichannel approach. \n\n  \n![Statista](https://www.artisan.co/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.ctfassets.net%2Fkyprwggh4muz%2F5YzwSs7UVhAJ1hhkwkiAUw%2F50461313092b8e3fb0ff41d23bbc91f0%2FStatista.png&w=3840&q=75)\n\nHere’s how to create content that hits those all-important engagement buttons:\n\n  \n\n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Understand the platform:** The type of longer-form written content that works on LinkedIn isn’t going to fly with Instagram audiences familiar with snappy video shorts. Platform-specific expertise is a must for your marketing team. \n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Focus on value:** Social media users are savvy. Always keep the question, “Where can I provide value?” at the forefront of your mind. Thought-leadership insights, original studies, and news commentary are all good contenders for content. Think in terms of your customers’ pain points. \n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Connect with influencers:** Share and share alike. Connect with and redistribute the content of other influencers, widening your audience and opening the door to potential collabs. \n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Use hashtags:** Yes, hashtags are still valuable. Use them appropriately and they can give your content a small lift. \n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Engage:** There’s nothing that screams, “I don’t care,” than a comments section without any replies from the poster. Show your audience you value them by responding to their comments and shares. \n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Don’t be scared to sell:** Being _over_ salesy is one of the surest ways to alienate your audience. But there’s a risk of going too far in the opposite direction, too. Around one in every five posts can include a call to action. \n    \n      \n    \n\n### 5\\. Consider Using Web Scraping Tools to Find Qualified Leads\n\nWeb scraping has become something of a dirty phrase in digital marketing. This is perhaps understandable because of how open to all sorts of evil spammery it is.\n\n  \n\nHowever, scraping can be done ethically, safely, and legally. Artisan, which collects data that’s shared with consent, is one example of a company operating ethically in this space. \n\n  \n\nHere are four tips to conduct web scraping safely: \n\n  \n\n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    Use tools like [Artisan](http://artisan.co)\n    , Octoparse, Import.io, and ParseHub to extract contact information from websites. You don’t need any technical expertise to do this. \n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    Ensure compliance with data privacy regulations and ethical guidelines when scraping data. For example, GDPR applies in the EU. Generally speaking, third-party providers will take care of regulatory responsibilities. \n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    Clean and verify scraped data to maintain accuracy and relevance. Ensuring the accuracy of data can have a significant effect on your outreach delivery rate. \n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    Test the effectiveness of different databases. Not all databases are equal and there can be significant differences in lead quality and accuracy. Some databases are better suited to specific industries. \n    \n      \n    \n\n![Web Scrapping](https://www.artisan.co/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.ctfassets.net%2Fkyprwggh4muz%2F5MbZzNWRrmq4ugFzoGFxRc%2F492040183ca55e4a321565dc11fadfc9%2FWeb_Scrapping.webp&w=3840&q=75)\n\n### 6\\. Leverage SEO-Focused Content Marketing to Attract Leads \n\nCompanies with blogs produce an average of [67% more leads per month](https://www.demandmetric.com/content/content-marketing-infographic)\n than companies that don’t have active blogs. \n\n  \n\nIn addition, well-executed SEO strategies can drive an [ROI of up to 1000%](https://sagapixel.com/seo/seo-roi-statistics/)\n. Not bad by any stretch of the imagination.\n\n  \n\nHere’s how to make SEO-based content marketing work for you:\n\n  \n\n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Diversify your strategy:** Create high-quality, informative content in a range of formats. Short blog posts, long pillar articles, case studies, ebooks, and whitepapers all have a place. \n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Target “sweet spot” KWs:** While it’s important not to overestimate the competitiveness of the keywords you can rank for, going for the easiest option isn’t always best, either. Find the sweet spot KWs you can rank for given your domain’s authority. \n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Put quality first:** EEAT has become one of the most well-known Google acronyms among content marketers. It stands for Experience, Expertise, Authority and Trust. Prioritize these factors when creating content. \n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Take care of technical SEO:** Keyword density, featured snippets, content length, meta descriptions, internal links—all are important for rankings. Content quality is vital. But don’t overlook the technicalities. \n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Tailor your CTA to the relevant stage of your funnel:** A page with high buyer intent, like “Best lawyer to get me out of prison now”, should push visitors to book a call or buy a service immediately. Pages with lower buyer intent, such as “What's the difference between a divorce and criminal lawyer,” should have a softer call to action, such as the opportunity to download a free guide in exchange for an email. \n    \n      \n    \n\n### 7\\. Generate Leads by Re-Engaging Your Email List\n\nYour email list likely contains at least some unengaged subscribers. These are potential customers, and it often doesn’t take much to reconnect. \n\n  \n\nSo, how can you turn uninterested subscribers into sizzling hot leads? Enter the re-engagement campaign…\n\n  \n![Follow Up](https://www.artisan.co/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.ctfassets.net%2Fkyprwggh4muz%2F1vxRwnunFTzV3KgCjihdGs%2F97b023a1a3e48eb062c9f0ef0f5d20d4%2FFollow_Up.webp&w=3840&q=75)\n\nHere’s a quick five-step process for re-engaging inactive subscribers: \n\n  \n\n1.  ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    Segment your inactive B2B subscribers where possible, such as by age, location, or sign-up date.\n    \n      \n    \n2.  ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    Send them a tailored offer such as a voucher or free gift.\n    \n      \n    \n3.  ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    Automate follow-up reminder emails.\n    \n      \n    \n4.  ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    Nurture the leads who have shown initial interest with further personalized emails and offers. \n    \n      \n    \n5.  ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    Use a clear call to action prompting them to trial your product or book a call with the sales team. \n    \n      \n    \n\n### 8\\. Use Cold Outreach to Find New B2B Leads\n\nDoes the thought of _cold_ outreach send a shiver down your spine? If you’re put off by the idea, you’re not alone. \n\n  \n\nHowever, cold outreach, especially email, works. Studies show that the [average response rate of around 17%](https://woodpecker.co/blog/cold-email-statistics/)\n for personalized emails of the kind Artisan provides is . \n\n  \n\nHere are some key tips to help you get the most out of cold outreach: \n\n  \n\n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Take a multi-channel approach:** The best approaches leverage multiple channels, with email outreach, social media outreach, and cold calling all accounted for.\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Automate wherever possible:** Cold outreach requires scale. As such, AI and automation tools can help to enhance efficiency by scheduling and automating email sequences and crafting personalized messages based on prospect data and behavior.\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Personalize, personalize, personalize:** Personalization is crucial. You don’t need to hand-write every message with a fountain pen. A good template with ample space for your automation tool to add individual elements is more than enough.\n    \n      \n    \n\n![Email List](https://www.artisan.co/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.ctfassets.net%2Fkyprwggh4muz%2F1AEpLDGyLZs8axCXVU5XtX%2Fda76da7e662606c1715dccf18795f310%2FEmail_List.webp&w=3840&q=75)\n\nA tool like Artisan is perfect for cold email automation. The AI functionality, unmatched by any competitors, allows for a level of personalization much greater than traditional if-then automations. \n\n  \n\n### 9\\. Host Webinars for B2B Sales Leads\n\nWebinars have mahoosive (that’s the technical term) conversion rates, and they’re excellent for turning cold leads into hot ones. In fact, [73% of B2B marketers](https://www.hubilo.com/blog/webinar-benchmarks)\n say that webinars are their “most effective” lead gen strategy. \n\n  \n\nHere are some tips for hosting next-level webinars:\n\n  \n\n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    Ask your existing audience, which is likely a sample of your broader market, what webinar topics they’re interested in. \n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    Always collect registration data to follow up with attendees afterward.\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    Include a clear call to action at the end of webinars, whether to sign up to your service or book a sales call. \n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    Make webinars available for a period after they’ve ended to overcome timezone constraints. \n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    Repurpose webinar content into other formats like blog posts and infographics to extend reach.\n    \n      \n    \n\n  \n\nSome marketers worry that webinars represent a complex technical challenge. A few years ago, this might have been true. However, with the prevalence of easy-to-use webinar software, this is no longer the case. \n\n  \n\n### 10\\. Optimize Website Landing Pages to Increase B2B Leads\n\nWhen does a website visitor become a lead? \n\n  \n\nWe’re sure there are lots of technical business-school answers to this question. But we prefer a simpler working definition: a visitor becomes a lead when they pass on their contact details. \n\n  \n\nHere are three tips for using landing pages to turn visitors into leads:\n\n  \n\n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    Create dedicated landing pages for specific marketing campaigns and ads targeting B2B leads (there’s nothing worse than a landing page totally out of sync with an advert). \n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    A/B test landing page elements such as headlines, CTAs, and forms to improve conversion rates _on an ongoing basis_. \n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    Use analytics tools to identify and replicate your best landing pages and associated offers.\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    Ensure that technical on-site elements like your page structure and navigation are easy to use. \n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    Always include a clear, straightforward CTA on your landing pages, whether a download link for a lead magnet or the option to book a sales call. \n    \n      \n    \n\nBest Tools to Supplement Your B2B Lead Generation Strategies\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\nOnce you’ve got an ironclad marketing strategy, you need tools to help you execute. \n\n  \n\nMost marketers rely on an integrated tech stack rather than a single tool. That said, the trend in recent years has been towards multifunctional all-in-one platforms rather than narrow “point” solutions. While you’ll have additional tools for supporting tasks, most of your sales prospecting will likely take place in a single app. \n\n  \n\nWe recommend that you try the different solutions on offer to get a sense of which one best fits your business. \n\n  \n\nHere’s a quick overview of the top lead generation tools to get you started: \n\n  \n\n### 1\\.

Whether you’re a bootstrapped startup founder wearing multiple hats or a junior marketer at an international SaaS enterprise, your company’s very existence hinges on your ability to drive _consistent and high-quality_ leads. \n\n  \n\nLead gen will never be easy. But you can make it significantly less difficult by basing your strategy on the right mix of techniques and bolstering them with well-chosen tools.\n\n  \n\nIf you’re new to B2B lead generation, this guide will help you build your system from the ground up. If you’re a seasoned pro, you’ll find tips and suggestions to further refine and develop your approach. \n\n  \n\nSound good? To quote perhaps the most overused ChatGPTism, let’s “dive” in. \n\n  \n\nWhat Is B2B Lead Generation?\n----------------------------\n\n![Resarching Leads](https://www.artisan.co/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.ctfassets.net%2Fkyprwggh4muz%2F7HNApk4KdUyLPeX8oXTir5%2F8c280ca79198503c491690a3fe8ecf80%2FResarching_Leads.webp&w=3840&q=75)\n\nB2B lead generation is the process of identifying and engaging potential customers. Lead generation focuses on the initial awareness or “top of funnel” phase of the customer acquisition journey. \n\n  \n\nThere are several categories of leads. Marketing-qualified leads (MQLs) and sales-qualified leads (SQLs) are the most important. A marketing-qualified lead is a lead who has shown enough interest in your product or service—such as by responding to an ad or reaching out for more information—to be seen as having a reasonable likelihood of becoming a customer. \n\n  \n\nAt this stage, lead _generation_ ends and lead _nurturing_ begins. Lead nurturing is usually the responsibility of the sales team (although marketing teams may play a role alongside sales reps). A lead transitions from an MQL to an SQL when they have been through the nurturing process and are ready to buy. \n\n  \n\nLead generation is important because it’s the foundation of any successful sales funnel. It’s directly tied to baseline metrics like revenue, growth and profitability. B2B companies with effective lead generation strategies generate [133% more revenue](https://intellistart.co.uk/what-is-lead-generation-and-why-is-it-important/)\n compared to “average” companies that don’t fully engage potential buyers.\n\n  \n\nHow to Find B2B Leads That Boost Your Business\n----------------------------------------------\n\nWithout further ado, let’s look at the strategies themselves. Keep in mind that the idea isn’t to apply everything blindly. Rather, you should find the right _mix_ for your target audience and product. \n\n  \n\n### 1\\. Find B2B Leads via LinkedIn Sales Navigator \n\nLinkedIn has one of the most complete, most accurate B2B lead databases. [89% of B2B marketers](https://sproutsocial.com/insights/linkedin-statistics/)\n use LinkedIn for lead generation, and 62% say its effective over the long term.\n\n  \n![Resarching Leads-1](https://www.artisan.co/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.ctfassets.net%2Fkyprwggh4muz%2F2EosHwTyHHy77922dquhWw%2Fffbe25a3678b9597ab029d5df6be6230%2FResarching_Leads-1.webp&w=3840&q=75)\n\nHere’s how to generate leads with LinkedIn Sales Navigator. \n\n  \n\n1.  ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    Purchase a paid LinkedIn plan if you don’t already have one. \n    \n      \n    \n2.  ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    Use advanced search filters to target specific industries, company sizes, job titles, etc. based on your ideal customer profile (ICP). \n    \n      \n    \n3.  ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    Use LinkedIn's InMail feature to reach out directly to B2B prospects and decision-makers with a personalized message that clearly outlines your value proposition. \n    \n      \n    \n4.  ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    Follow up, again keeping everything personalized. \n    \n      \n    \n\n  \n\nHere’s a sample template based on the three Cs (compliment, case study, call to action) of successful outreach: \n\n  \n\n_Hi {prospect name},_\n\n  \n\n_Love what you’re doing at {prospect company name}. I was particularly impressed by your {recent prospect company achievement)._ \n\n  \n\n_At {your company name}, we provide {your service}. We recently helped one of our clients achieve {client result)._ \n\n  \n\n_We’d love to do the same for you. Are you free for a quick call this week?_ \n\n  \n\nAnd here’s what an example looks like in practice with Microsoft as an example:\n\n  \n\n_Hi Bill,_\n\n  \n\n_Love what you’re doing at Microsoft. I was particularly impressed by your latest VR headset release._ \n\n  \n\n_At Artisan, we provide fully automated, AI-driven lead gen. We recently helped one of our clients triple their VR sales._ \n\n  \n\n_We’d love to do the same for you. Are you free for a quick call this week?_ \n\n  \n\n### 2\\. Start a Customer Referral Program\n\nResearch shows that referral programs are among the most effective low-cost lead-gen strategies, with [86% of companies](https://viral-loops.com/referral-marketing/statistics)\n that use referral programs experiencing growth. \n\n  \n\nIf you don’t already have a referral program, you’re potentially missing out on Everest-size mountains of inexpensive leads. \n\n  \n\nHere’s how to launch a referral program:\n\n  \n\n1.  ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Decide on an attractive referral incentive.** Incentivize existing customers to refer new leads by offering discounts, rewards, or bonuses. Offer an incentive to _both_ the referrer and the recipient. \n    \n      \n    \n2.  ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Build referral infrastructure.** Create referral program landing pages and track referrals through your CRM. While there’s significant variability between industries, data shows that a referral rate (the percentage of your total sales that come from referrals) of [around 10%](https://www.alexanderjarvis.com/what-is-referral-rate-what-is-the-formula-and-why-it-is-important/)\n     is healthy. \n    \n      \n    \n3.  ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Contact existing customers.** Foster strong relationships with customers to encourage advocacy and referrals. Include referral emails in your email onboarding sequences and newsletter broadcasts.\n    \n      \n    \n4.  ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Test and refine.** You’re unlikely to create a perfect referral program right off the bat, and that’s OK. Continuous A/B testing of your incentives, landing pages, and email outreach ensures ongoing improvement. \n    \n      \n    \n\n![Referal](https://www.artisan.co/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.ctfassets.net%2Fkyprwggh4muz%2F4piiizGmNxKg2NVRNDaCjC%2Ffec690faa57c6620b576c550d287b7ef%2FReferal.webp&w=3840&q=75)\n\n### 3\\. Find and Reach Qualified Leads With AI Sales Tools\n\nAI sales tools streamline the process of finding and reaching qualified leads through automated lead scoring, data enrichment, personalized outreach, and hands-off optimization. \n\n  \n\nAI sales tools also allow salespeople to focus on high-value activities like pursuing the most promising potential leads, which is the key to improving conversion rates and, ultimately, revenue.\n\n  \n\nLet’s take the example of [Artisan](https://www.artisan.co/)\n, an advanced lead-gen AI tool, to see how you would prospect in this way:\n\n  \n\n1.  ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    Define your ICPs in detail to lay the basis for personalization and segmentation. \n    \n      \n    \n2.  ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    Create outreach templates, allowing AI to add a high level of lead personalization. \n    \n      \n    \n3.  ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    Let Artisan consult its lead database of over 300 million leads to put together a highly relevant list of targets. \n    \n      \n    \n4.  ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    Use AI-based insights to improve your response and conversion rates with ongoing outreach optimization and lead scoring.\n    \n      \n    \n\n  \n\nTools like Artisan are powerful for two main reasons. \n\n  \n\nFirst, they allow for a largely hands-off approach, with AI taking over many manual tasks such as outreach personalization and lead filtering. \n\n  \n\nSecond, they are excellent for scaling. The size of Artisan’s database and the unlimited capacity of its AI engine means you can ramp up your lead gen in a fraction of the time it might otherwise take. \n\n  \n![AI Help](https://www.artisan.co/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.ctfassets.net%2Fkyprwggh4muz%2F2ijTJTlQ9N3n4AVK7P9yhH%2F4d705d21ef00d41a2ecd4ca51b4f3415%2FAI_Help.webp&w=3840&q=75)\n\n**Ready to find perfect-fit B2B leads on autopilot?** Supercharge your sales with Ava, Artisan’s AI business development representative.

Engage Prospects Through Social Media\n\nLinkedIn is the [top platform for B2B](https://www.statista.com/statistics/1445198/leading-social-media-platforms-used-for-b2b-marketing/)\n marketing, with YouTube coming in second. Instagram, Facebook, and Twitter are also powerful, pointing towards the need for an omnichannel approach. \n\n  \n![Statista](https://www.artisan.co/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.ctfassets.net%2Fkyprwggh4muz%2F5YzwSs7UVhAJ1hhkwkiAUw%2F50461313092b8e3fb0ff41d23bbc91f0%2FStatista.png&w=3840&q=75)\n\nHere’s how to create content that hits those all-important engagement buttons:\n\n  \n\n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Understand the platform:** The type of longer-form written content that works on LinkedIn isn’t going to fly with Instagram audiences familiar with snappy video shorts. Platform-specific expertise is a must for your marketing team. \n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Focus on value:** Social media users are savvy. Always keep the question, “Where can I provide value?” at the forefront of your mind. Thought-leadership insights, original studies, and news commentary are all good contenders for content. Think in terms of your customers’ pain points. \n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Connect with influencers:** Share and share alike. Connect with and redistribute the content of other influencers, widening your audience and opening the door to potential collabs. \n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Use hashtags:** Yes, hashtags are still valuable. Use them appropriately and they can give your content a small lift. \n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Engage:** There’s nothing that screams, “I don’t care,” than a comments section without any replies from the poster. Show your audience you value them by responding to their comments and shares. \n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Don’t be scared to sell:** Being _over_ salesy is one of the surest ways to alienate your audience. But there’s a risk of going too far in the opposite direction, too. Around one in every five posts can include a call to action. \n    \n      \n    \n\n### 5\\. Consider Using Web Scraping Tools to Find Qualified Leads\n\nWeb scraping has become something of a dirty phrase in digital marketing. This is perhaps understandable because of how open to all sorts of evil spammery it is.\n\n  \n\nHowever, scraping can be done ethically, safely, and legally. Artisan, which collects data that’s shared with consent, is one example of a company operating ethically in this space. \n\n  \n\nHere are four tips to conduct web scraping safely: \n\n  \n\n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    Use tools like [Artisan](http://artisan.co)\n    , Octoparse, Import.io, and ParseHub to extract contact information from websites. You don’t need any technical expertise to do this. \n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    Ensure compliance with data privacy regulations and ethical guidelines when scraping data. For example, GDPR applies in the EU. Generally speaking, third-party providers will take care of regulatory responsibilities. \n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    Clean and verify scraped data to maintain accuracy and relevance. Ensuring the accuracy of data can have a significant effect on your outreach delivery rate. \n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    Test the effectiveness of different databases. Not all databases are equal and there can be significant differences in lead quality and accuracy. Some databases are better suited to specific industries. \n    \n      \n    \n\n![Web Scrapping](https://www.artisan.co/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.ctfassets.net%2Fkyprwggh4muz%2F5MbZzNWRrmq4ugFzoGFxRc%2F492040183ca55e4a321565dc11fadfc9%2FWeb_Scrapping.webp&w=3840&q=75)\n\n### 6\\. Leverage SEO-Focused Content Marketing to Attract Leads \n\nCompanies with blogs produce an average of [67% more leads per month](https://www.demandmetric.com/content/content-marketing-infographic)\n than companies that don’t have active blogs. \n\n  \n\nIn addition, well-executed SEO strategies can drive an [ROI of up to 1000%](https://sagapixel.com/seo/seo-roi-statistics/)\n. Not bad by any stretch of the imagination.\n\n  \n\nHere’s how to make SEO-based content marketing work for you:\n\n  \n\n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Diversify your strategy:** Create high-quality, informative content in a range of formats. Short blog posts, long pillar articles, case studies, ebooks, and whitepapers all have a place. \n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Target “sweet spot” KWs:** While it’s important not to overestimate the competitiveness of the keywords you can rank for, going for the easiest option isn’t always best, either. Find the sweet spot KWs you can rank for given your domain’s authority. \n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Put quality first:** EEAT has become one of the most well-known Google acronyms among content marketers. It stands for Experience, Expertise, Authority and Trust. Prioritize these factors when creating content. \n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Take care of technical SEO:** Keyword density, featured snippets, content length, meta descriptions, internal links—all are important for rankings. Content quality is vital. But don’t overlook the technicalities. \n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Tailor your CTA to the relevant stage of your funnel:** A page with high buyer intent, like “Best lawyer to get me out of prison now”, should push visitors to book a call or buy a service immediately. Pages with lower buyer intent, such as “What's the difference between a divorce and criminal lawyer,” should have a softer call to action, such as the opportunity to download a free guide in exchange for an email. \n    \n      \n    \n\n### 7\\. Generate Leads by Re-Engaging Your Email List\n\nYour email list likely contains at least some unengaged subscribers. These are potential customers, and it often doesn’t take much to reconnect. \n\n  \n\nSo, how can you turn uninterested subscribers into sizzling hot leads? Enter the re-engagement campaign…\n\n  \n![Follow Up](https://www.artisan.co/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.ctfassets.net%2Fkyprwggh4muz%2F1vxRwnunFTzV3KgCjihdGs%2F97b023a1a3e48eb062c9f0ef0f5d20d4%2FFollow_Up.webp&w=3840&q=75)\n\nHere’s a quick five-step process for re-engaging inactive subscribers: \n\n  \n\n1.  ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    Segment your inactive B2B subscribers where possible, such as by age, location, or sign-up date.\n    \n      \n    \n2.  ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    Send them a tailored offer such as a voucher or free gift.\n    \n      \n    \n3.  ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    Automate follow-up reminder emails.\n    \n      \n    \n4.  ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    Nurture the leads who have shown initial interest with further personalized emails and offers. \n    \n      \n    \n5.  ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    Use a clear call to action prompting them to trial your product or book a call with the sales team. \n    \n      \n    \n\n### 8\\. Use Cold Outreach to Find New B2B Leads\n\nDoes the thought of _cold_ outreach send a shiver down your spine? If you’re put off by the idea, you’re not alone. \n\n  \n\nHowever, cold outreach, especially email, works. Studies show that the [average response rate of around 17%](https://woodpecker.co/blog/cold-email-statistics/)\n for personalized emails of the kind Artisan provides is . \n\n  \n\nHere are some key tips to help you get the most out of cold outreach: \n\n  \n\n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Take a multi-channel approach:** The best approaches leverage multiple channels, with email outreach, social media outreach, and cold calling all accounted for.\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Automate wherever possible:** Cold outreach requires scale. As such, AI and automation tools can help to enhance efficiency by scheduling and automating email sequences and crafting personalized messages based on prospect data and behavior.\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Personalize, personalize, personalize:** Personalization is crucial. You don’t need to hand-write every message with a fountain pen. A good template with ample space for your automation tool to add individual elements is more than enough.\n    \n      \n    \n\n![Email List](https://www.artisan.co/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.ctfassets.net%2Fkyprwggh4muz%2F1AEpLDGyLZs8axCXVU5XtX%2Fda76da7e662606c1715dccf18795f310%2FEmail_List.webp&w=3840&q=75)\n\nA tool like Artisan is perfect for cold email automation. The AI functionality, unmatched by any competitors, allows for a level of personalization much greater than traditional if-then automations. \n\n  \n\n### 9\\. Host Webinars for B2B Sales Leads\n\nWebinars have mahoosive (that’s the technical term) conversion rates, and they’re excellent for turning cold leads into hot ones. In fact, [73% of B2B marketers](https://www.hubilo.com/blog/webinar-benchmarks)\n say that webinars are their “most effective” lead gen strategy. \n\n  \n\nHere are some tips for hosting next-level webinars:\n\n  \n\n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    Ask your existing audience, which is likely a sample of your broader market, what webinar topics they’re interested in. \n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    Always collect registration data to follow up with attendees afterward.\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    Include a clear call to action at the end of webinars, whether to sign up to your service or book a sales call. \n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    Make webinars available for a period after they’ve ended to overcome timezone constraints. \n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    Repurpose webinar content into other formats like blog posts and infographics to extend reach.\n    \n      \n    \n\n  \n\nSome marketers worry that webinars represent a complex technical challenge. A few years ago, this might have been true. However, with the prevalence of easy-to-use webinar software, this is no longer the case. \n\n  \n\n### 10\\. Optimize Website Landing Pages to Increase B2B Leads\n\nWhen does a website visitor become a lead? \n\n  \n\nWe’re sure there are lots of technical business-school answers to this question. But we prefer a simpler working definition: a visitor becomes a lead when they pass on their contact details. \n\n  \n\nHere are three tips for using landing pages to turn visitors into leads:\n\n  \n\n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    Create dedicated landing pages for specific marketing campaigns and ads targeting B2B leads (there’s nothing worse than a landing page totally out of sync with an advert). \n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    A/B test landing page elements such as headlines, CTAs, and forms to improve conversion rates _on an ongoing basis_. \n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    Use analytics tools to identify and replicate your best landing pages and associated offers.\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    Ensure that technical on-site elements like your page structure and navigation are easy to use. \n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    Always include a clear, straightforward CTA on your landing pages, whether a download link for a lead magnet or the option to book a sales call. \n    \n      \n    \n\nBest Tools to Supplement Your B2B Lead Generation Strategies\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\nOnce you’ve got an ironclad marketing strategy, you need tools to help you execute. \n\n  \n\nMost marketers rely on an integrated tech stack rather than a single tool. That said, the trend in recent years has been towards multifunctional all-in-one platforms rather than narrow “point” solutions. While you’ll have additional tools for supporting tasks, most of your sales prospecting will likely take place in a single app. \n\n  \n\nWe recommend that you try the different solutions on offer to get a sense of which one best fits your business. \n\n  \n\nHere’s a quick overview of the top lead generation tools to get you started: \n\n  \n\n### 1\\.

Well, you can.\n\n  \n\nAI SDRs are no longer a thing of the future—they're here and taking over the workflows that have slowed our sales teams for decades.\n\n  \n\nIn this guide, we'll introduce you to AI SDRs and show you how to implement them into your workflows to generate more _qualified_ leads.\n\n  \n\nUnderstanding AI SDRs\n---------------------\n\nWith only [17% of reps](https://www.techtarget.com/white-paper-ebook/how-does-your-sales-development-program-measure-up/)\n achieving 90% or higher of quota, AI SDRs are shifting from being a \"nice to have\" to becoming a major competitive advantage for sales teams.\n\n  \n![ai-vs-sdr](https://www.artisan.co/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.ctfassets.net%2Fkyprwggh4muz%2F3n63zl0JDoIZYZhizXnjhz%2Ffda06a35a9577c6ffaf9f4564064d117%2Fai-vs-sdr.webp&w=3840&q=75)\n\n### What is an AI SDR?\n\nAn AI SDR, or AI sales development representative, is software that uses artificial intelligence to perform the tasks typically handled by a human SDR.\n\n  \n\nThe use cases of AI SDRs in sales teams vary. You might entrust them with the entire prospecting process or have them handle specific manual tasks, freeing up your human SDRs to focus on things that matter most. How deeply you integrate AI SDRs in your workflows depends on your comfort with the technology and the sophistication of your tech stack.\n\n  \n\nFurther down the article, we’ll give you all the information you need to choose the best approach for your business.\n\n  \n\nAI vs Human SDRs\n----------------\n\nWhen thinking about adding AI to your team, it's normal to ask, _\"How does AI compare to human employees?\"_ \n\n  \n\nSo, let's break it down and explore the differences and benefits of each.\n\n  \n\n#### AI SDRs\n\nIn many instances, AI SDRs outperform human agents:\n\n  \n\n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Scalable processes.** Most SDR tasks like cold outreach, follow-ups, and lead scoring are repeatable. With a well-structured process in place, AI can take over these tasks and reach your SDR quota way faster.\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Consistent messaging.** You don’t have to worry about your messages sounding off. Unlike humans, AI sticks to the script.\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Automated optimization.** AI SDRs constantly evaluate their performance in the background and make adjustments on the fly. No need to spend hours poring over data.\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Lower investment.** Scaling SDR with AI doesn’t come with payroll costs or extensive training programs.\n    \n      \n    \n\n**Ava is an AI SDR ready to take over your outbound prospecting.** [Discover](https://www.artisan.co/ai-sales-agent)\n how she can accelerate your sales process.  \n\n  \n\n#### Human SDRs\n\nYet there are traits only inherent to human SDRs: \n\n  \n\n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Decision-making in unscripted scenarios.** While AI can make decisions based on data input, only human SDRs can manage situations that deviate from the ordinary.\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Ability to build personal connection and rapport with customers.** Humans can apply their personal traits and emotional intelligence to appeal to leads and create stronger connections with them. \n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Understanding of cultural nuances and subtle cues.** Human SDRs better handle ongoing conversations for their ability to spot and interpret cultural nuances and contextual cues.\n    \n      \n    \n\n**  \nWho comes out on top in the AI SDR vs. human SDR debate?** While we'd love to offer a new angle, the answer remains the same: there's no competition between AI and humans to determine winners and losers. AI SDRs will scale your operations and remove the need to hire more SDRs, but you still need a human to move your qualified leads down the funnel.\n\n  \n![human-sdr](https://www.artisan.co/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.ctfassets.net%2Fkyprwggh4muz%2F4nNfy6sdMg4rRlby3o1YSK%2Fcdaeb42d3fbab06fe43e8d43915f6f89%2Fhuman-sdr.webp&w=3840&q=75)\n\n4 Reasons to implement AI SDRs\n------------------------------\n\nIn 2023, less than [5% of B2B sales activities](https://www.gartner.com/en/newsroom/press-releases/2023-09-21-gartner-expects-sixty-percent-of-seller-work-to-be-executed-by-generative-ai-technologies-within-five-years)\n were powered by generative AI technologies. By 2028, the number will reach 60%. Such a trend is easily explained by the numerous benefits of AI in sales, particularly in SDR.\n\n  \n\n### Automate and scale prospecting\n\nStruggling to meet your monthly quota? It's no surprise—your human SDRs spend hours scouring databases, scraping the web for personalization insights, and crafting individualized messages, over and over again. Oh, and don’t forget about follow-ups… \n\n  \n\nWith AI SDRs, you can automate all these tasks so your human agents can focus solely on mapping out the process. \n\n  \n\n**Ava has a database of 300M+ B2B prospects that she can instantly search to pinpoint your target customer personas.** She also automatically scrapes the web and social media pages to find insights that she uses to personalize the emails she writes. [Try Ava now.](https://www.artisan.co/ai-sales-agent)\n\n  \n\n### Create a consistent experience for leads\n\nMisspelling names, forgetting follow-ups, or having to change communication points—these can happen even to the best SDRs. _Do we even need to discuss how it impacts the lead experience?_\n\n  \n\nAI SDRs let you create a smooth experience for every contact, no matter what. They don’t have vacations or bad days—nothing slips through the cracks in AI-powered processes.\n\n  \n\nIn Artisan, you can create a three-step email sequence that will be sent out every two days so you don’t have to worry about manual follow-ups. If the lead replies, Ava will stop the sequence.\n\n  \n![consistent-experience](https://www.artisan.co/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.ctfassets.net%2Fkyprwggh4muz%2F1wZULY7jP5FKlQyLKqDuti%2F16e60d88e18a408730f89696c87b0eb5%2Fconsistent-experience.webp&w=3840&q=75)\n\n### Enhance your outreach with data-driven actions\n\nAI is great at analyzing data—it can handle large amounts of information and find patterns that humans might miss.\n\n  \n\nBest of all, AI SDRs can use the data to act fast. For example, they can send a follow-up message when a user repeatedly visits your site or reach out to a prospect after they've posted a career update on LinkedIn.\n\n  \n\n### Let human SDRs focus on high-priority tasks\n\nAI SDRs are primarily designed to free up your human agents for more critical responsibilities. If your human SDRs have been struggling to prioritize leads and connect with high-ticket prospects, now is the time to address it.\n\n  \n\n**Curious about what Ava can do for your sales team?** [Hire Ava now](https://artisan.co/ava-sales-rep/)\n to experience how AI can accelerate your outbound cycle. She can automate over 80% of manual tasks!\n\n  \n\nThe Top 5 AI SDRs\n-----------------\n\nBefore we dive deeper into the specific applications of AI SDRs in the sales process, let's take a look at the technology that makes it all possible _(and prove we aren’t talking science fiction)_.\n\n  \n\n### 1\\.

You can choose one of the [AI Sales Playbooks](https://www.artisan.co/products/sales-playbooks)\n to determine how Ava will approach your leads. \n\n  \n![playbook](https://www.artisan.co/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.ctfassets.net%2Fkyprwggh4muz%2F37Rgod1zduhkac1a248BKM%2Fd2d31c174fc4b0bbbdc78179a4ec38b0%2Fplaybook.webp&w=3840&q=75)\n\n_All in all, nothing speaks better than customers’ success stories, right?_ Medical contract research organization (CRO) [bioaccess](https://www.bioaccessla.com/)\n entrusted Ava with business development. In just two months, Julio Martinez-Clark, CEO of bioaccess, reports outstanding results:\n\n  \n\n_“I have been using Ava for about two months. I have had a consistent +3% response rate and four sales calls leading to potential sales. Ava simplifies my company’s business development process and fills my calendar with sales calls. This is precisely what I wanted.

AiSDR\n\n![aisdr](https://www.artisan.co/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.ctfassets.net%2Fkyprwggh4muz%2F3MGfHjzWJxyj0MGldZ2eYc%2F03955716ab30939893ee47b3d4d60734%2Faisdr.webp&w=3840&q=75)\n\nAiSDR provides AI bots for sales development, focusing on crafting realistic AI emails. \n\n  \n\nSimilar to Ava, AiSDR scrapes a vast lead database and initiates conversations with leads that match your ICP. The system analyzes leads' latest LinkedIn activity and uses the data to personalize cold pitches.\n\n  \n\nUsers have noted that AiSDR lacks integrations with essential business software such as Salesforce. If integration capabilities are critical for you, consider alternative options from our list.\n\n  \n\n### 3\\. 11x\n\n![11x](https://www.artisan.co/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.ctfassets.net%2Fkyprwggh4muz%2F3pvK5G1Oe6U2PL6WmuLoUa%2Fa5c1cc27d258af1d136436cc6580e4c3%2F11x.webp&w=3840&q=75)\n\nOn a mission to empower teams with AI workers, 11x has recently introduced Alice, an AI-powered SDR.\n\n  \n\nAlice identifies potential buyers, researches relevant lead data, and engages them with personalized messages - but you are not able to communicate with Alice. Users have reported issues with bugs on the platform leading to emails being generated in the wrong language.\n\n  \n\n### 4\\. Relevance.ai\n\n![relevance-ai](https://www.artisan.co/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.ctfassets.net%2Fkyprwggh4muz%2F6Rw6nVaWCN1ZJ4iZYI8C5Z%2F6f80b7bc748694573a3930fce3de8ee4%2Frelevance-ai.webp&w=3840&q=75)\n\nMeet Bosh, the AI SDR from Relevance.ai.\n\n  \n\nBosh offers flexibility and integration options. You can deeply integrate it into your workflows, going beyond outbound and prospecting tasks, but the company does not specialize in creating AI SDRs, hence it is less of a focus for them.\n\n  \n\nOf course, this flexibility comes with a trade-off. Setting up the agent involves extensive training, configuring, and testing the bot.\n\n  \n\n### Integrating AI SDR with existing sales workflows\n\n_“Okay, that sounds good in theory. How do I fit them into my workflows?”_\n\n  \n\nWell, the answer depends on what your existing workflows look like and to what extent you want to automate them with AI SDRs. But regardless of the specifics, your AI SDR integration starts here:\n\n  \n\n#### CRM integration\n\nSo you’re managing your sales process through a CRM system. You can integrate your AI SDRs with it to track your interaction with prospects across all channels in one place.\n\n  \n![crm-integration](https://www.artisan.co/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.ctfassets.net%2Fkyprwggh4muz%2F9wmbmcGzEM2Fu2TlaaG2I%2Fb996520f25ac3cc44972dd3b602447b5%2Fcrm-integration.webp&w=3840&q=75)\n\nAva, for instance, integrates seamlessly with HubSpot and Salesforce, allowing sales teams to: \n\n  \n\n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    Prevent outreach to existing customers and prospects\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    Export all lead data to a centralized system\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    Build a pipeline with highly qualified leads\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    Reach out to existing prospects that have gone cold\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    Build custom sales workflows powered by GenAI \n    \n      \n    \n\n  \nYou can start by using your AI SDR to find and nurture qualified leads, then send them to your CRM system's pipeline for further processing.\n\n  \n\n#### Unified communication channels\n\nEven if you entrust your prospecting process to AI SDRs, you’ll want to stay updated on those conversations. By integrating them into your company’s unified communications, you’ll keep everyone involved updated on the prospecting process and lead updates.\n\n  \n\nAva integrates with Slack, so you don’t have to keep logging into Artisan for updates. All notifications will appear in a dedicated channel you can share with specific team members.\n\n  \n![unified-communication](https://www.artisan.co/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.ctfassets.net%2Fkyprwggh4muz%2FoSQ8YxGKZLRiMPmmD5xxK%2F4a3aa5c2844ada24a71bb7cfcc47a502%2Funified-communication.webp&w=3840&q=75)\n\n#### Automated task assignment\n\nDepending on how deeply you integrate AI into your sales workflows, you’ll want to interfere at different stages. \n\n  \n\nIf you’re just starting out, you may want to approve all of your AI SDR’s actions before it proceeds. As you gain confidence in the system, you might only need to intervene when a user responds to the AI outreach or even later in the process. \n\n  \n\nThis is where you need to integrate your AI SDRs with your task management software—so you don’t have to manually review every step in the AI workflow and _inevitably_ miss crucial moments for intervention. \n\n  \n\nWhether you use ClickUp, Monday, or manage your team’s tasks directly in your CRM system, Ava will soon be able to seamlessly integrate with any platform through Zapier. Simply set trigger events and let automation update your team’s to-do list.\n\n  \n\n**Want to try Ava for yourself?** [Hire Ava now](https://artisan.co/ava-sales-rep/)\n, and she’ll execute successful outbound strategies to boost your conversion rates. Get more meetings booked into your calendar instantly.\n\n  \n\nAI SDR in lead generation\n-------------------------\n\nLead generation is typically the most repetitive and automatable task in SDR—perfect for being offloaded to AI. \n\n  \n\nHere’s how AI SDRs enhance lead generation:\n\n  \n\n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **More accurate lead qualification.** In 2023, [41% of sales pros](https://blog.hubspot.com/sales/ai-sales-prospecting)\n     were already using AI tools to qualify leads. Considering the rapid adoption of AI, these numbers have likely skyrocketed since then. Clearly, AI SDRs will soon be indispensable to the lead qualification process.\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Personalized outreach at scale.** When you have 200 pre-qualified leads in your pipeline, spending just two minutes to personalize each message would take almost seven hours of work. AI SDRs can do it faster and without errors. \n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **24/7 operation.** AI SDRs don’t sleep, take breaks, or go on vacation. They can work around the clock, making contact with leads at the best times, regardless of the time zone.\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Lead enrichment.** Keeping lead profiles updated is hard. AI SDRs like [Artisan’s Ava](https://www.artisan.co/ai-sales-agent)\n     continuously scrape web and third-party data to update your leads' profiles with relevant information, ensuring you always have reliable data.\n    \n      \n    \n\n![ai-sdr-lead-gen](https://www.artisan.co/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.ctfassets.net%2Fkyprwggh4muz%2F3Zn0tdht4EGjrnzcqGyYtp%2Fc91e0447d4907aebb4865644e78703f3%2Fai-sdr-lead-gen.webp&w=3840&q=75)\n\nAI SDR in different sales processes\n-----------------------------------\n\nAnd how do AI SDRs fit into outbound and inbound sales processes? Let’s see. \n\n  \n\n### Using AI SDRs for outbound sales \n\nOutbound SDRs always have their plates full. Not that other members of sales teams aren’t busy, but the outbound sales process involves the most draining repetitive tasks, such as:\n\n  \n\n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    Email warmup\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    Lead discovery and research\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    Cold email personalization and outreach\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    Follow-ups\n    \n      \n    \n\n  \n…and so on in a continuous cycle. AI SDRs can take over _all_ of these outbound sales tasks, saving human SDRs’ energy for handling high-intent leads.\n\n  \n\n**Yes, Ava automates the entire outbound sales process.** Ready to give it a try? [Talk to our sales team.](https://www.artisan.co/talk-to-sales?page_source=/talk-to-sales)\n\n  \n\n### Using AI SDRs for inbound sales\n\nAI SDRs are primarily used for automating outbound processes, and understandably so. It's easier to rely on AI when there's minimal risk involved. _If they find good leads, great! If not, it's no big deal._\n\n  \n![automate-and-scale](https://www.artisan.co/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.ctfassets.net%2Fkyprwggh4muz%2F1BRx1MwzdewbrrcDvbPY21%2Fe22691e7416a51a0b4b46d7a8a974693%2Fautomate-and-scale.webp&w=3840&q=75)\n\nInbound sales are trickier. We’ve all had our share of impersonal AI chatbot interactions and don’t want to lose those inbound leads to a glitchy AI process. But it's time to leave that mindset in the past.\n\n  \n\nAI SDRs go far beyond crafting cold emails. They can support inbound sales by:\n\n  \n\n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    Automating meeting scheduling\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    Identifying high-intent buyers with AI-driven sentiment analysis\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    Transcribing and summarizing discovery calls\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    Preparing sales meeting agenda\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    Crafting follow-ups\n    \n      \n    \n\n  \nYou can start introducing AI SDRs into inbound sales by letting them take over neglected tasks. Say, if your agents fail to regularly analyze their calls _(we know they do),_ let AI SDRs handle it. Enjoyed the results? Gradually increase their responsibilities.\n\n  \n\nImpact on sales teams\n---------------------\n\n[Eighty-two percent](https://offers.hubspot.com/sales-trends-report)\n of sales reps agree that building relationships and connecting are the most important and fulfilling aspects of their job. With AI, they can finally focus on it.\n\n  \n![ai-sdr-banner](https://www.artisan.co/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.ctfassets.net%2Fkyprwggh4muz%2F3gbBpPzXERC4pq7s2a3oEL%2Fd4b9fbe6fa486adbe8dd7d201e7bb4fe%2Fai-sdr-banner.webp&w=3840&q=75)\n\nDepending on your current structure and needs, an AI SDR like Ava can assume various responsibilities within your SDR team:\n\n  \n\n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **One-person outbound sales team.** As a solo startup founder, you can rely on AI SDRs to fill your calendar with sales calls. No need to hire a dedicated team with your limited resources.\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Top-of-funnel lead generator.** If your A-level SDR team is struggling to meet quotas, bring in AI SDRs to swiftly fill the top of the funnel with qualified leads.\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Pocket assistant for human SDRs.** AI-powered virtual assistants can free up your SDRs for high-priority tasks by automating manual processes from lead qualification to copywriting.\n    \n      \n    \n\n**Ava can replicate your top-performing BDRs and share their strategies across your entire team.** Ready to give it a try?

It will only take months before AI SDRs will become even more sophisticated and widespread.\n\n  \n![growth-trust-ai](https://www.artisan.co/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.ctfassets.net%2Fkyprwggh4muz%2F2RH5UgSE1BMEfRKS2l3yQq%2F4005e8140b15e100efcf78eb4c53960c%2Fgrowth-trust-ai.webp&w=3840&q=75)\n\n### Growing trust in AI \n\n[Seventy-eight percent](https://research.g2.com/2023-buyer-behavior-report)\n of buyers already trust the accuracy and reliability of AI-powered solutions.

Well, you can.\n\n  \n\nAI SDRs are no longer a thing of the future—they're here and taking over the workflows that have slowed our sales teams for decades.\n\n  \n\nIn this guide, we'll introduce you to AI SDRs and show you how to implement them into your workflows to generate more _qualified_ leads.\n\n  \n\nUnderstanding AI SDRs\n---------------------\n\nWith only [17% of reps](https://www.techtarget.com/white-paper-ebook/how-does-your-sales-development-program-measure-up/)\n achieving 90% or higher of quota, AI SDRs are shifting from being a \"nice to have\" to becoming a major competitive advantage for sales teams.\n\n  \n![ai-vs-sdr](https://www.artisan.co/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.ctfassets.net%2Fkyprwggh4muz%2F3n63zl0JDoIZYZhizXnjhz%2Ffda06a35a9577c6ffaf9f4564064d117%2Fai-vs-sdr.webp&w=3840&q=75)\n\n### What is an AI SDR?\n\nAn AI SDR, or AI sales development representative, is software that uses artificial intelligence to perform the tasks typically handled by a human SDR.\n\n  \n\nThe use cases of AI SDRs in sales teams vary. You might entrust them with the entire prospecting process or have them handle specific manual tasks, freeing up your human SDRs to focus on things that matter most. How deeply you integrate AI SDRs in your workflows depends on your comfort with the technology and the sophistication of your tech stack.\n\n  \n\nFurther down the article, we’ll give you all the information you need to choose the best approach for your business.\n\n  \n\nAI vs Human SDRs\n----------------\n\nWhen thinking about adding AI to your team, it's normal to ask, _\"How does AI compare to human employees?\"_ \n\n  \n\nSo, let's break it down and explore the differences and benefits of each.\n\n  \n\n#### AI SDRs\n\nIn many instances, AI SDRs outperform human agents:\n\n  \n\n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Scalable processes.** Most SDR tasks like cold outreach, follow-ups, and lead scoring are repeatable. With a well-structured process in place, AI can take over these tasks and reach your SDR quota way faster.\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Consistent messaging.** You don’t have to worry about your messages sounding off. Unlike humans, AI sticks to the script.\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Automated optimization.** AI SDRs constantly evaluate their performance in the background and make adjustments on the fly. No need to spend hours poring over data.\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Lower investment.** Scaling SDR with AI doesn’t come with payroll costs or extensive training programs.\n    \n      \n    \n\n**Ava is an AI SDR ready to take over your outbound prospecting.** [Discover](https://www.artisan.co/ai-sales-agent)\n how she can accelerate your sales process.  \n\n  \n\n#### Human SDRs\n\nYet there are traits only inherent to human SDRs: \n\n  \n\n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Decision-making in unscripted scenarios.** While AI can make decisions based on data input, only human SDRs can manage situations that deviate from the ordinary.\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Ability to build personal connection and rapport with customers.** Humans can apply their personal traits and emotional intelligence to appeal to leads and create stronger connections with them. \n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Understanding of cultural nuances and subtle cues.** Human SDRs better handle ongoing conversations for their ability to spot and interpret cultural nuances and contextual cues.\n    \n      \n    \n\n**  \nWho comes out on top in the AI SDR vs. human SDR debate?** While we'd love to offer a new angle, the answer remains the same: there's no competition between AI and humans to determine winners and losers. AI SDRs will scale your operations and remove the need to hire more SDRs, but you still need a human to move your qualified leads down the funnel.\n\n  \n![human-sdr](https://www.artisan.co/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.ctfassets.net%2Fkyprwggh4muz%2F4nNfy6sdMg4rRlby3o1YSK%2Fcdaeb42d3fbab06fe43e8d43915f6f89%2Fhuman-sdr.webp&w=3840&q=75)\n\n4 Reasons to implement AI SDRs\n------------------------------\n\nIn 2023, less than [5% of B2B sales activities](https://www.gartner.com/en/newsroom/press-releases/2023-09-21-gartner-expects-sixty-percent-of-seller-work-to-be-executed-by-generative-ai-technologies-within-five-years)\n were powered by generative AI technologies. By 2028, the number will reach 60%. Such a trend is easily explained by the numerous benefits of AI in sales, particularly in SDR.\n\n  \n\n### Automate and scale prospecting\n\nStruggling to meet your monthly quota? It's no surprise—your human SDRs spend hours scouring databases, scraping the web for personalization insights, and crafting individualized messages, over and over again. Oh, and don’t forget about follow-ups… \n\n  \n\nWith AI SDRs, you can automate all these tasks so your human agents can focus solely on mapping out the process. \n\n  \n\n**Ava has a database of 300M+ B2B prospects that she can instantly search to pinpoint your target customer personas.** She also automatically scrapes the web and social media pages to find insights that she uses to personalize the emails she writes. [Try Ava now.](https://www.artisan.co/ai-sales-agent)\n\n  \n\n### Create a consistent experience for leads\n\nMisspelling names, forgetting follow-ups, or having to change communication points—these can happen even to the best SDRs. _Do we even need to discuss how it impacts the lead experience?_\n\n  \n\nAI SDRs let you create a smooth experience for every contact, no matter what. They don’t have vacations or bad days—nothing slips through the cracks in AI-powered processes.\n\n  \n\nIn Artisan, you can create a three-step email sequence that will be sent out every two days so you don’t have to worry about manual follow-ups. If the lead replies, Ava will stop the sequence.\n\n  \n![consistent-experience](https://www.artisan.co/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.ctfassets.net%2Fkyprwggh4muz%2F1wZULY7jP5FKlQyLKqDuti%2F16e60d88e18a408730f89696c87b0eb5%2Fconsistent-experience.webp&w=3840&q=75)\n\n### Enhance your outreach with data-driven actions\n\nAI is great at analyzing data—it can handle large amounts of information and find patterns that humans might miss.\n\n  \n\nBest of all, AI SDRs can use the data to act fast. For example, they can send a follow-up message when a user repeatedly visits your site or reach out to a prospect after they've posted a career update on LinkedIn.\n\n  \n\n### Let human SDRs focus on high-priority tasks\n\nAI SDRs are primarily designed to free up your human agents for more critical responsibilities. If your human SDRs have been struggling to prioritize leads and connect with high-ticket prospects, now is the time to address it.\n\n  \n\n**Curious about what Ava can do for your sales team?** [Hire Ava now](https://artisan.co/ava-sales-rep/)\n to experience how AI can accelerate your outbound cycle.

If integration capabilities are critical for you, consider alternative options from our list.\n\n  \n\n### 3\\. 11x\n\n![11x](https://www.artisan.co/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.ctfassets.net%2Fkyprwggh4muz%2F3pvK5G1Oe6U2PL6WmuLoUa%2Fa5c1cc27d258af1d136436cc6580e4c3%2F11x.webp&w=3840&q=75)\n\nOn a mission to empower teams with AI workers, 11x has recently introduced Alice, an AI-powered SDR.\n\n  \n\nAlice identifies potential buyers, researches relevant lead data, and engages them with personalized messages - but you are not able to communicate with Alice. Users have reported issues with bugs on the platform leading to emails being generated in the wrong language.\n\n  \n\n### 4\\. Relevance.ai\n\n![relevance-ai](https://www.artisan.co/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.ctfassets.net%2Fkyprwggh4muz%2F6Rw6nVaWCN1ZJ4iZYI8C5Z%2F6f80b7bc748694573a3930fce3de8ee4%2Frelevance-ai.webp&w=3840&q=75)\n\nMeet Bosh, the AI SDR from Relevance.ai.\n\n  \n\nBosh offers flexibility and integration options. You can deeply integrate it into your workflows, going beyond outbound and prospecting tasks, but the company does not specialize in creating AI SDRs, hence it is less of a focus for them.\n\n  \n\nOf course, this flexibility comes with a trade-off. Setting up the agent involves extensive training, configuring, and testing the bot.\n\n  \n\n### Integrating AI SDR with existing sales workflows\n\n_“Okay, that sounds good in theory. How do I fit them into my workflows?”_\n\n  \n\nWell, the answer depends on what your existing workflows look like and to what extent you want to automate them with AI SDRs. But regardless of the specifics, your AI SDR integration starts here:\n\n  \n\n#### CRM integration\n\nSo you’re managing your sales process through a CRM system. You can integrate your AI SDRs with it to track your interaction with prospects across all channels in one place.\n\n  \n![crm-integration](https://www.artisan.co/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.ctfassets.net%2Fkyprwggh4muz%2F9wmbmcGzEM2Fu2TlaaG2I%2Fb996520f25ac3cc44972dd3b602447b5%2Fcrm-integration.webp&w=3840&q=75)\n\nAva, for instance, integrates seamlessly with HubSpot and Salesforce, allowing sales teams to: \n\n  \n\n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    Prevent outreach to existing customers and prospects\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    Export all lead data to a centralized system\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    Build a pipeline with highly qualified leads\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    Reach out to existing prospects that have gone cold\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    Build custom sales workflows powered by GenAI \n    \n      \n    \n\n  \nYou can start by using your AI SDR to find and nurture qualified leads, then send them to your CRM system's pipeline for further processing.\n\n  \n\n#### Unified communication channels\n\nEven if you entrust your prospecting process to AI SDRs, you’ll want to stay updated on those conversations. By integrating them into your company’s unified communications, you’ll keep everyone involved updated on the prospecting process and lead updates.\n\n  \n\nAva integrates with Slack, so you don’t have to keep logging into Artisan for updates. All notifications will appear in a dedicated channel you can share with specific team members.\n\n  \n![unified-communication](https://www.artisan.co/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.ctfassets.net%2Fkyprwggh4muz%2FoSQ8YxGKZLRiMPmmD5xxK%2F4a3aa5c2844ada24a71bb7cfcc47a502%2Funified-communication.webp&w=3840&q=75)\n\n#### Automated task assignment\n\nDepending on how deeply you integrate AI into your sales workflows, you’ll want to interfere at different stages. \n\n  \n\nIf you’re just starting out, you may want to approve all of your AI SDR’s actions before it proceeds. As you gain confidence in the system, you might only need to intervene when a user responds to the AI outreach or even later in the process. \n\n  \n\nThis is where you need to integrate your AI SDRs with your task management software—so you don’t have to manually review every step in the AI workflow and _inevitably_ miss crucial moments for intervention. \n\n  \n\nWhether you use ClickUp, Monday, or manage your team’s tasks directly in your CRM system, Ava will soon be able to seamlessly integrate with any platform through Zapier. Simply set trigger events and let automation update your team’s to-do list.\n\n  \n\n**Want to try Ava for yourself?** [Hire Ava now](https://artisan.co/ava-sales-rep/)\n, and she’ll execute successful outbound strategies to boost your conversion rates. Get more meetings booked into your calendar instantly.\n\n  \n\nAI SDR in lead generation\n-------------------------\n\nLead generation is typically the most repetitive and automatable task in SDR—perfect for being offloaded to AI. \n\n  \n\nHere’s how AI SDRs enhance lead generation:\n\n  \n\n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **More accurate lead qualification.** In 2023, [41% of sales pros](https://blog.hubspot.com/sales/ai-sales-prospecting)\n     were already using AI tools to qualify leads. Considering the rapid adoption of AI, these numbers have likely skyrocketed since then. Clearly, AI SDRs will soon be indispensable to the lead qualification process.\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Personalized outreach at scale.** When you have 200 pre-qualified leads in your pipeline, spending just two minutes to personalize each message would take almost seven hours of work. AI SDRs can do it faster and without errors. \n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **24/7 operation.** AI SDRs don’t sleep, take breaks, or go on vacation. They can work around the clock, making contact with leads at the best times, regardless of the time zone.\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Lead enrichment.** Keeping lead profiles updated is hard. AI SDRs like [Artisan’s Ava](https://www.artisan.co/ai-sales-agent)\n     continuously scrape web and third-party data to update your leads' profiles with relevant information, ensuring you always have reliable data.\n    \n      \n    \n\n![ai-sdr-lead-gen](https://www.artisan.co/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.ctfassets.net%2Fkyprwggh4muz%2F3Zn0tdht4EGjrnzcqGyYtp%2Fc91e0447d4907aebb4865644e78703f3%2Fai-sdr-lead-gen.webp&w=3840&q=75)\n\nAI SDR in different sales processes\n-----------------------------------\n\nAnd how do AI SDRs fit into outbound and inbound sales processes? Let’s see. \n\n  \n\n### Using AI SDRs for outbound sales \n\nOutbound SDRs always have their plates full. Not that other members of sales teams aren’t busy, but the outbound sales process involves the most draining repetitive tasks, such as:\n\n  \n\n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    Email warmup\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    Lead discovery and research\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    Cold email personalization and outreach\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    Follow-ups\n    \n      \n    \n\n  \n…and so on in a continuous cycle. AI SDRs can take over _all_ of these outbound sales tasks, saving human SDRs’ energy for handling high-intent leads.\n\n  \n\n**Yes, Ava automates the entire outbound sales process.** Ready to give it a try? [Talk to our sales team.](https://www.artisan.co/talk-to-sales?page_source=/talk-to-sales)\n\n  \n\n### Using AI SDRs for inbound sales\n\nAI SDRs are primarily used for automating outbound processes, and understandably so. It's easier to rely on AI when there's minimal risk involved. _If they find good leads, great! If not, it's no big deal._\n\n  \n![automate-and-scale](https://www.artisan.co/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.ctfassets.net%2Fkyprwggh4muz%2F1BRx1MwzdewbrrcDvbPY21%2Fe22691e7416a51a0b4b46d7a8a974693%2Fautomate-and-scale.webp&w=3840&q=75)\n\nInbound sales are trickier. We’ve all had our share of impersonal AI chatbot interactions and don’t want to lose those inbound leads to a glitchy AI process. But it's time to leave that mindset in the past.\n\n  \n\nAI SDRs go far beyond crafting cold emails. They can support inbound sales by:\n\n  \n\n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    Automating meeting scheduling\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    Identifying high-intent buyers with AI-driven sentiment analysis\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    Transcribing and summarizing discovery calls\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    Preparing sales meeting agenda\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    Crafting follow-ups\n    \n      \n    \n\n  \nYou can start introducing AI SDRs into inbound sales by letting them take over neglected tasks. Say, if your agents fail to regularly analyze their calls _(we know they do),_ let AI SDRs handle it. Enjoyed the results? Gradually increase their responsibilities.\n\n  \n\nImpact on sales teams\n---------------------\n\n[Eighty-two percent](https://offers.hubspot.com/sales-trends-report)\n of sales reps agree that building relationships and connecting are the most important and fulfilling aspects of their job. With AI, they can finally focus on it.\n\n  \n![ai-sdr-banner](https://www.artisan.co/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.ctfassets.net%2Fkyprwggh4muz%2F3gbBpPzXERC4pq7s2a3oEL%2Fd4b9fbe6fa486adbe8dd7d201e7bb4fe%2Fai-sdr-banner.webp&w=3840&q=75)\n\nDepending on your current structure and needs, an AI SDR like Ava can assume various responsibilities within your SDR team:\n\n  \n\n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **One-person outbound sales team.** As a solo startup founder, you can rely on AI SDRs to fill your calendar with sales calls. No need to hire a dedicated team with your limited resources.\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Top-of-funnel lead generator.** If your A-level SDR team is struggling to meet quotas, bring in AI SDRs to swiftly fill the top of the funnel with qualified leads.\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Pocket assistant for human SDRs.** AI-powered virtual assistants can free up your SDRs for high-priority tasks by automating manual processes from lead qualification to copywriting.\n    \n      \n    \n\n**Ava can replicate your top-performing BDRs and share their strategies across your entire team.** Ready to give it a try?

It will only take months before AI SDRs will become even more sophisticated and widespread.\n\n  \n![growth-trust-ai](https://www.artisan.co/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.ctfassets.net%2Fkyprwggh4muz%2F2RH5UgSE1BMEfRKS2l3yQq%2F4005e8140b15e100efcf78eb4c53960c%2Fgrowth-trust-ai.webp&w=3840&q=75)\n\n### Growing trust in AI \n\n[Seventy-eight percent](https://research.g2.com/2023-buyer-behavior-report)\n of buyers already trust the accuracy and reliability of AI-powered solutions. This number is only increasing as language learning models and AI solutions continue to improve their accuracy.\n\n  \n\nWith [66% of B2B sales teams](https://offers.hubspot.com/ai-sales)\n having already invested in AI or automation tools, AI SDRs will soon become an inseparable part of successful sales teams.\n\n  \n\n### More capabilities to come\n\nTechnological development has accelerated to a point where you don’t have to wait for the next major update for years.\n\n  \n\nFor now, most AI SDRs successfully handle outbound activities like lead qualification and cold outreach. In a few months, our developers will release many more capabilities, including call monitoring, direct meeting scheduling capabilities, sales agenda outlining, and more. \n\n  \n\nAva and other AI SDRs are on track to offer end-to-end sales development solutions, consolidating fragmented product stacks under one roof.\n\n  \n\n**Get started with an AI SDR now.** [Hire Ava now](https://artisan.co/ava-sales-rep/)\n, and she’ll launch a lead generation campaign for you immediately. \n\n  \n\n  \n\nShare Article\n\n![copy-link](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/copy-link.svg)[![copy-link](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/mail.svg)](mailto:?body=https://www.artisan.co/blog/ai-sdr)\n\nYou might also like\n-------------------\n\n[![The 4 Best SaaS Sales Models to Boost Revenue](https://www.artisan.co/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.ctfassets.net%2Fkyprwggh4muz%2F5OHRBD7XR7LA9eP1R6iR3q%2F4a545afaa84ba2a0756a42eea0b6087b%2FCover.webp&w=3840&q=100)\\\n\\\nsales\\\n\\\nThe 4 Best SaaS Sales Models to Boost Revenue\\\n---------------------------------------------\\\n\\\nAugust 1, 2024\\\n\\\n13 minutes](/blog/b2b-saas-sales-model)\n[![B2B Sales KPIs: A Guide to Growth Metrics That Matter](https://www.artisan.co/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.ctfassets.net%2Fkyprwggh4muz%2F2JYvJUQs7Zt2uqfO6w3j7h%2F091e63ed4a3adbdf0d98cb47aec3a647%2FCover_.webp&w=3840&q=100)\\\n\\\nSales\\\n\\\nB2B Sales KPIs: A Guide to Growth Metrics That Matter\\\n-----------------------------------------------------\\\n\\\nAugust 2, 2024\\\n\\\n13 minutes](/blog/b2b-sales-kpis)\n[![What is B2B Outbound Sales?

As the name suggests, these touchpoints are arranged sequentially, a pathway for your sales team to engage future customers.\n\n  \n![pipeline 1](https://www.artisan.co/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.ctfassets.net%2Fkyprwggh4muz%2F4wCVJjZBMRvA8jWzCo1qxr%2F94ddb42ba85123cec204c3b78703b7ce%2Fpipeline_1.webp&w=3840&q=75)\n\nMore importantly, the pipeline gives your team the visibility and structure to understand the relationships between different stages, what it means to nurture customers through various stages, and how to optimize each part of the pipeline to increase leads and sales. \n\n  \n\nBenefits of a Structured Sales Pipeline\n---------------------------------------\n\nThe point of a sales pipeline is to ensure that leads follow a well-structured path where your organization can engage them every step of the way. \n\n  \n\nSome of the core benefits of a well-structured B2B sales pipeline include the following:\n\n  \n\n### 1\\. Improved sales forecasting accuracy\n\nSince your pipeline will contain well-defined and demarcated engagement and lead evaluation stages, it is much easier to understand how far each lead has gone down the pipeline and forecast potential sales. And, with increased forecasting accuracy comes increased revenue. \n\n  \n\n### 2\\. Enhanced lead management and nurturing\n\nWith optimized sales pipeline management, sales can more effectively nurture potential buyers toward a purchase using behavioral data, targeted messaging, and advanced lead nurturing techniques that draw from accurate lead qualifications and multi-channel communications. \n\n  \n\n### 3\\. Increased visibility into the sales process\n\nA sales pipeline gives you a bird's-eye view of your prospecting and nurturing landscape, with the option of zooming in to view any specific contact point. This means a clearer vision of the customer journey, particular processes for nurturing leads, and places where poor sales tactics or performance bottlenecks limit productivity.\n\n  \n\n### 4\\. Better alignment between sales and marketing efforts\n\nSales and marketing departments often work on different schedules and priorities. That being said, marketing is critical to help raise brand awareness and nurture leads through the sales process with enablement materials and other types of content. With a well-structured pipeline, you can make sure your marketing materials are tailored for specific leads at specific points of their customer journey.\n\n  \n\nB2B Sales Pipeline vs. B2B Sales Funnel\n---------------------------------------\n\nIf you are around marketing and sales professionals, you might hear phrases like “funnel” and “pipeline” used interchangeably (and incorrectly). These frameworks represent fundamentally different ideas for shaping the customer journey through various sales activities.\n\n  \n![Pipeline vs funnel](https://www.artisan.co/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.ctfassets.net%2Fkyprwggh4muz%2F1W7rDeXNtXRBN8Ub0t0gzo%2F6e299f313768ed7bd3af0e5cab09549c%2FPipeline_vs_funnel.webp&w=3840&q=75)\n\n### Focus and Scope\n\n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **A sales pipeline describes how a lead moves through an ongoing sales process, from lead generation to conversion and maintenance**. You might consider this your perspective on generating leads, demonstrating a product’s features, and optimizing customer engagement via strategic outreach. When mapping a B2B pipeline, you’ll most likely focus on metrics like sales performance, lead generation, and how leads are nurtured from one process point to another. \n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **A sales funnel represents the customer’s approach to your product or service, starting with broad awareness (the “mouth” or the “top of the funnel”) and moving through consideration, evaluation, and sale (the “bottom of the funnel”).** The scope of the funnel includes metrics on initial contact, conversion rates at different parts of the funnel, and where (potentially) paying customers enter the funnel. \n    \n      \n    \n\n### Stages and Progression\n\n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **The sales pipeline involves more sequential processes** involving direct action from your salespeople or automation technologies. These stages start with sales prospecting and move through lead qualification, needs assessment, and so on, to a final sale and ongoing support. At each point of this pipeline, the emphasis is on _action._ Sales representatives understand how the actions and data collected inform their performance in the next task.\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    On the other hand, **the sales funnel details the customer journey and what they might look for during that journey****_._** The broader strategies deployed at the top of the funnel (awareness) represent potential customers just learning about your brand, and outreach throughout that buying process moves with the customer towards consideration, evaluation, and intent to purchase. This approach is much more generalized than the pipeline approach. \n    \n      \n    \n\n  \n\nWhile the funnel gives a big-picture understanding of a customer journey, the pipeline reflects specific stages and optimized actions during those stages.\n\n  \n\n8 Essential B2B Sales Pipeline Stages\n-------------------------------------\n\n![pipeline](https://www.artisan.co/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.ctfassets.net%2Fkyprwggh4muz%2F3wbRYus0jgFg8QOVmbTs1D%2Fbcbb1347b90415ab76c4b433bf926988%2Fpipeline.webp&w=3840&q=75)\n\n### Stage 1: Prospecting Potential Customers\n\nThe sales cycle starts with potential customers. You must have an ideal picture of your customer and an understanding of how to reach that target audience. \n\n  \n\nThe first step in sales pipeline management is to generate ICPs that reflect the customers you want to approach. Creating a good ICP will involve identifying your top B2B companies based on demographics, financial characteristics, and behavioral characteristics – information that you should be able to utilize through an advanced platform like Artisan and our database of 300M+ B2B contacts. \n\n  \n\nThe next step involves prospecting potential inbound customers that align with your ideal customer profile. Outreach can include cold calling and cold emailing, networking at industry events, or (more common in modern sales) leveraging social media platforms like LinkedIn to target potential leads with paid and organic messaging.\n\n  \n\n### Stage 2: Lead Qualification\n\nLead qualification determines a new lead's value against your business or product strategies. Sales experts can apply any of the criteria or methodologies to apply a score to potential candidates to separate the “wheat from the chaff” or, more accurately, poor leads from those with the potential to become sales. \n\n  \n\nTo qualify leads, you should focus on scoring criteria based on a methodology. What is important to you–demographics? Revenue? Behaviors?\n\n  \n\nLeads can be scored across criteria like:\n\n  \n\n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Demographics** include professional positions, industry, location, and income. \n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Behavioral** qualities like responses to email sequences or browsing patterns on e-commerce sites. \n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Predictive lead scoring**, usually supported by machine learning or AI, can use historical and CRM data to predict a lead's potential. \n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Negative scoring** takes points away from leads with specific criteria. \n    \n      \n    \n\n  \n\nTypically, approaching scoring through a single criterion will have the least amount of flexibility or accuracy to qualify leads. A more comprehensive framework allows you to rank leads across several criteria. \n\n  \n\nOne such framework is the Budget, Authority, Need, and Timeline ([BANT](https://www.techtarget.com/searchcustomerexperience/definition/BANT)\n) framework, which combines a few data points to qualify a lead: who they are, whether they can make decisions, and whether they can afford the solution.\n\n  \n![ava prospecting](https://www.artisan.co/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.ctfassets.net%2Fkyprwggh4muz%2F3hq0OjgXaTBviGFJNudOIa%2Fd8514f4f24d264f10aa7e36b0e68ba81%2Fava_prospecting.webp&w=3840&q=75)\n\nAnother approach you can deploy is [MEDDIC](https://meddicc.com/meddic-sales-qualification-and-frameworks)\n (Metrics, Economic buyer, Decision criteria, Decision process, Identifying pain, and Champion). MEDDIC is a more in-depth alternative to BANT, asking you to understand pain points and customer decision-making processes. \n\n  \n\nBANT and MEDDIC criteria can be formulated during the initial prospecting stage through conversations, surveys, or interviews. This involves specialized and targeted questions that can gather this information:\n\n  \n\n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Phone calls** can be an immediate and “human” approach to information-gathering, but they require a time investment from the prospect.\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Emails** are much more convenient but often ignored; even the best piece of email marketing can be lost or forgotten in a bust inbox.\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Surveys** are great ways to gather specific information but can feel informal or a chore for a prospect. \n    \n      \n    \n\n  \n\n**Use Artisan’s database of 300M+ B2B contacts to build an elite lead-scoring framework.** [Try Ava Now](https://www.artisan.co/ai-sales-agent)\n.\n\n  \n\n### Stage 3: Needs Assessment\n\nMaking a sale is impossible without clearly understanding the new customer’s needs. Fortunately, there’s a great way to find that information during initial and ongoing meetings. \n\n  \n\nOnce you’ve identified, prospected, and qualified a lead, it’s critical to identify their pain points and explain how your solution solves them. \n\n  \n\nSome more effective ways to get leads to open up about pain points include:\n\n  \n\n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    Using open-ended questions to provoke thoughtful responses. \n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    Using follow-up questions to dig into details of specific challenges.\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    Develop hypothetical scenarios where the customer has to talk about a particular approach or ideal for their organization. \n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    Ask about personal insights alongside quantifiable faces (i.e., “Why do you think X is a problem?”)\n    \n      \n    \n\nYou could also offer a free demo at this juncture. [Hubspot notes](https://blog.hubspot.com/sales/sales-pipeline)\n that prospects are 75% likely to buy at the demo stage. \n\n  \n\n### Stage 4: Proposal Creation\n\nSo, you’ve identified a lead, qualified it, and you have a pretty good grasp of their needs and pain points. If you’re in this far, a buyer will expect a proposal outlining what purchasing might look like. This isn’t just an invoice or a marketing brochure; it’s an in-depth description of what the customer will get and how this customer relationship will unfold. \n\n  \n\nA typical proposal will include some primary sections like:\n\n  \n\n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **An introduction and needs statement t**hat outlines the terms of the relationship and the features and capabilities you are delivering to solve specific problems.\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **A description of the specific solutions, features, functions, or tools** sold or provided to the customer.\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Deliverables** like access to the product, any white-glove or support services, credits, and so on.\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **A timeline for these deliverables**, including immediate next steps.  \n     \n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Pricing, payment terms, and deadlines.**\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Case studies and testimonials** that demonstrate the value of your solution to decision-makers. \n    \n      \n    \n\n### Stage 5: Negotiation with Decision-Makers\n\nIf you have nurtured a prospect this far, congratulations – [leads at the negotiation stage are 90% likely to buy](https://blog.hubspot.com/sales/sales-pipeline)\n. The initial proposal isn’t a final agreement, however. Once it is in the customer's hands, negotiations will likely follow to hammer out specifics and reach a mutually beneficial arrangement. \n\n  \n\nSome of the more critical parts of negotiating with decision-makers include:\n\n  \n\n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    Identifying customer wants and needs and balancing them against your expectations, sales targets, and business goals.\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    Fielding objections and counter-proposals with understanding and flexibility without sacrificing profitability or growth. This will include a strong knowledge of the product and its capabilities.\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    Recognizing where negotiations have stalled and how to keep things moving forward, even if that includes escalation or including other stakeholders. \n    \n      \n    \n\n![Monitor](https://www.artisan.co/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.ctfassets.net%2Fkyprwggh4muz%2F5Qxzgsp0wPXwG12szyZP0G%2F7d080e3738965b22a3db1005487d4ec4%2FMonitor.webp&w=3840&q=75)\n\n### Stage 6: Closing Deals\n\nAll these negotiations lead toward the ultimate goal of closing the deal. However, getting a potential customer to make a final purchasing decision can be just as difficult as the negotiations proceeding with that decision. \n\n  \n\nHow can you close a deal effectively? You can:\n\n  \n\n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Act like the deal is closed (assumptive close)**, ushering the customer toward the adoption and onboarding phase.\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Create urgency (urgency close)** through limited-time deals or a window for accepting a proposal.\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Summarizing (summary close)** all the benefits the customer will experience is a way to highlight your product's positive aspects and keep the process moving.\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Maintain a direct approach (direct close)** and frankly approach the customer with a sense of transparency.\n    \n      \n    \n\n  \n\nNone of these approaches is one-size-fits-all, and you still need to apply common sense and intuition to understand if a lead is ready to buy. \n\n  \n\nSome signs that they want to move to the next stage include \n\n  \n\n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    Forward questions about implementation or budget\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    Discussions about specifics about the final terms of the proposal\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    Providing positive feedback on the proposal or product\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    Seeking a trial or demo of your product and services\n    \n      \n    \n\n### Stage 7: Implementation and Onboarding\n\nThe transition from sales to implementation is a crucial phase that ensures a smooth handover from the sales team to the implementation or customer success team. This phase is vital for maintaining customer satisfaction and ensuring that the promises made during the sales process are effectively delivered. \n\n  \n\nA **handover phase** will include initial kick-off meetings, planning, and expectation-setting. At this point, you’ll most likely cover the finer points of implementation, risk management, and security. \n\n  \n\nNext is **onboarding and training**. Sometimes, onboarding can be automated via online platforms and knowledge repositories. For more advanced training needs, support resources (like customer service and documentation) will complement a more robust engagement with virtual or on-site training programs. \n\n  \n\nFinally, **there’s monitoring to ensure customer success**. This is perhaps the most important part of implementation. You must have the workforce and support that the customer expects in place so that they remain a customer and meet the outcomes you identified during the sales process. \n\n  \n\n### Stage 8: Follow-Up and Support\n\nThe deal is done, and the customer is on board and using the solution. But your work isn’t over. It’s imperative to support that customer so that they get the best service possible. This leads to better feedback, better testimonials and stories, continued revenue, and the potential for future sales through referrals. \n\n  \n\nSupport is a proactive process. Treating customers as important as any other customer is also critical. This includes \n\n  \n\n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Having a dedicated point of contact** for the customer who is regularly available and responsive.\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Conducting proactive outreach** via regular check-ins.\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Automating regular surveys** triggered on specific events that allow customers to provide feedback.\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Using CRM systems** like Artisan that track ongoing interactions and keep records of customer preferences and needs.\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Create feedback loops** by constantly collecting, analyzing, and acting on customer data using your sales team, customer service team, and CRM.\n    \n      \n    \n\n  \n\nThese sales opportunities can be used to cross-sell or up-sell products or services that address existing or emerging customer needs. \n\n  \n\nOptimize Your B2B Sales Pipeline With AI\n----------------------------------------\n\n![AI](https://www.artisan.co/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.ctfassets.net%2Fkyprwggh4muz%2F3cxPxGQ0hL7TkwJRQ2s21P%2F204d67964080b860b4b9a8181196229c%2FAI.webp&w=3840&q=75)\n\n[A Hubspot report](https://offers.hubspot.com/sales-trends-report?hubs_signup-url=blog.hubspot.com%2Fsales%2Fsales-statistics&hubs_signup-cta=HubSpot&hubs_post=blog.hubspot.com%2Fsales%2Fsales-statistics&hubs_post-cta=HubSpot&_ga=2.51143532.45855186.1721953845-849358351.1719888644&_gl=1*1jbt6zv*_gcl_au*MTA4Njg5NTM4NC4xNzE5ODg4NjQ0*_ga*ODQ5MzU4MzUxLjE3MTk4ODg2NDQ.*_ga_LXTM6CQ0XK*MTcyMjAyMTg0Ny45LjAuMTcyMjAyMTg0Ny42MC4wLjA.)\n shows that 32% of salespeople see the volume of emails sent as a sign of productivity.

As the name suggests, these touchpoints are arranged sequentially, a pathway for your sales team to engage future customers.\n\n  \n![pipeline 1](https://www.artisan.co/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.ctfassets.net%2Fkyprwggh4muz%2F4wCVJjZBMRvA8jWzCo1qxr%2F94ddb42ba85123cec204c3b78703b7ce%2Fpipeline_1.webp&w=3840&q=75)\n\nMore importantly, the pipeline gives your team the visibility and structure to understand the relationships between different stages, what it means to nurture customers through various stages, and how to optimize each part of the pipeline to increase leads and sales. \n\n  \n\nBenefits of a Structured Sales Pipeline\n---------------------------------------\n\nThe point of a sales pipeline is to ensure that leads follow a well-structured path where your organization can engage them every step of the way. \n\n  \n\nSome of the core benefits of a well-structured B2B sales pipeline include the following:\n\n  \n\n### 1\\. Improved sales forecasting accuracy\n\nSince your pipeline will contain well-defined and demarcated engagement and lead evaluation stages, it is much easier to understand how far each lead has gone down the pipeline and forecast potential sales. And, with increased forecasting accuracy comes increased revenue. \n\n  \n\n### 2\\. Enhanced lead management and nurturing\n\nWith optimized sales pipeline management, sales can more effectively nurture potential buyers toward a purchase using behavioral data, targeted messaging, and advanced lead nurturing techniques that draw from accurate lead qualifications and multi-channel communications. \n\n  \n\n### 3\\. Increased visibility into the sales process\n\nA sales pipeline gives you a bird's-eye view of your prospecting and nurturing landscape, with the option of zooming in to view any specific contact point. This means a clearer vision of the customer journey, particular processes for nurturing leads, and places where poor sales tactics or performance bottlenecks limit productivity.\n\n  \n\n### 4\\. Better alignment between sales and marketing efforts\n\nSales and marketing departments often work on different schedules and priorities. That being said, marketing is critical to help raise brand awareness and nurture leads through the sales process with enablement materials and other types of content. With a well-structured pipeline, you can make sure your marketing materials are tailored for specific leads at specific points of their customer journey.\n\n  \n\nB2B Sales Pipeline vs. B2B Sales Funnel\n---------------------------------------\n\nIf you are around marketing and sales professionals, you might hear phrases like “funnel” and “pipeline” used interchangeably (and incorrectly). These frameworks represent fundamentally different ideas for shaping the customer journey through various sales activities.\n\n  \n![Pipeline vs funnel](https://www.artisan.co/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.ctfassets.net%2Fkyprwggh4muz%2F1W7rDeXNtXRBN8Ub0t0gzo%2F6e299f313768ed7bd3af0e5cab09549c%2FPipeline_vs_funnel.webp&w=3840&q=75)\n\n### Focus and Scope\n\n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **A sales pipeline describes how a lead moves through an ongoing sales process, from lead generation to conversion and maintenance**. You might consider this your perspective on generating leads, demonstrating a product’s features, and optimizing customer engagement via strategic outreach. When mapping a B2B pipeline, you’ll most likely focus on metrics like sales performance, lead generation, and how leads are nurtured from one process point to another. \n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **A sales funnel represents the customer’s approach to your product or service, starting with broad awareness (the “mouth” or the “top of the funnel”) and moving through consideration, evaluation, and sale (the “bottom of the funnel”).** The scope of the funnel includes metrics on initial contact, conversion rates at different parts of the funnel, and where (potentially) paying customers enter the funnel. \n    \n      \n    \n\n### Stages and Progression\n\n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **The sales pipeline involves more sequential processes** involving direct action from your salespeople or automation technologies. These stages start with sales prospecting and move through lead qualification, needs assessment, and so on, to a final sale and ongoing support. At each point of this pipeline, the emphasis is on _action._ Sales representatives understand how the actions and data collected inform their performance in the next task.\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    On the other hand, **the sales funnel details the customer journey and what they might look for during that journey****_._** The broader strategies deployed at the top of the funnel (awareness) represent potential customers just learning about your brand, and outreach throughout that buying process moves with the customer towards consideration, evaluation, and intent to purchase. This approach is much more generalized than the pipeline approach. \n    \n      \n    \n\n  \n\nWhile the funnel gives a big-picture understanding of a customer journey, the pipeline reflects specific stages and optimized actions during those stages.\n\n  \n\n8 Essential B2B Sales Pipeline Stages\n-------------------------------------\n\n![pipeline](https://www.artisan.co/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.ctfassets.net%2Fkyprwggh4muz%2F3wbRYus0jgFg8QOVmbTs1D%2Fbcbb1347b90415ab76c4b433bf926988%2Fpipeline.webp&w=3840&q=75)\n\n### Stage 1: Prospecting Potential Customers\n\nThe sales cycle starts with potential customers. You must have an ideal picture of your customer and an understanding of how to reach that target audience. \n\n  \n\nThe first step in sales pipeline management is to generate ICPs that reflect the customers you want to approach. Creating a good ICP will involve identifying your top B2B companies based on demographics, financial characteristics, and behavioral characteristics – information that you should be able to utilize through an advanced platform like Artisan and our database of 300M+ B2B contacts. \n\n  \n\nThe next step involves prospecting potential inbound customers that align with your ideal customer profile. Outreach can include cold calling and cold emailing, networking at industry events, or (more common in modern sales) leveraging social media platforms like LinkedIn to target potential leads with paid and organic messaging.\n\n  \n\n### Stage 2: Lead Qualification\n\nLead qualification determines a new lead's value against your business or product strategies. Sales experts can apply any of the criteria or methodologies to apply a score to potential candidates to separate the “wheat from the chaff” or, more accurately, poor leads from those with the potential to become sales. \n\n  \n\nTo qualify leads, you should focus on scoring criteria based on a methodology. What is important to you–demographics? Revenue? Behaviors?\n\n  \n\nLeads can be scored across criteria like:\n\n  \n\n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Demographics** include professional positions, industry, location, and income. \n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Behavioral** qualities like responses to email sequences or browsing patterns on e-commerce sites. \n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Predictive lead scoring**, usually supported by machine learning or AI, can use historical and CRM data to predict a lead's potential. \n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Negative scoring** takes points away from leads with specific criteria. \n    \n      \n    \n\n  \n\nTypically, approaching scoring through a single criterion will have the least amount of flexibility or accuracy to qualify leads. A more comprehensive framework allows you to rank leads across several criteria. \n\n  \n\nOne such framework is the Budget, Authority, Need, and Timeline ([BANT](https://www.techtarget.com/searchcustomerexperience/definition/BANT)\n) framework, which combines a few data points to qualify a lead: who they are, whether they can make decisions, and whether they can afford the solution.\n\n  \n![ava prospecting](https://www.artisan.co/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.ctfassets.net%2Fkyprwggh4muz%2F3hq0OjgXaTBviGFJNudOIa%2Fd8514f4f24d264f10aa7e36b0e68ba81%2Fava_prospecting.webp&w=3840&q=75)\n\nAnother approach you can deploy is [MEDDIC](https://meddicc.com/meddic-sales-qualification-and-frameworks)\n (Metrics, Economic buyer, Decision criteria, Decision process, Identifying pain, and Champion). MEDDIC is a more in-depth alternative to BANT, asking you to understand pain points and customer decision-making processes. \n\n  \n\nBANT and MEDDIC criteria can be formulated during the initial prospecting stage through conversations, surveys, or interviews. This involves specialized and targeted questions that can gather this information:\n\n  \n\n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Phone calls** can be an immediate and “human” approach to information-gathering, but they require a time investment from the prospect.\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Emails** are much more convenient but often ignored; even the best piece of email marketing can be lost or forgotten in a bust inbox.\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Surveys** are great ways to gather specific information but can feel informal or a chore for a prospect. \n    \n      \n    \n\n  \n\n**Use Artisan’s database of 300M+ B2B contacts to build an elite lead-scoring framework.** [Try Ava Now](https://www.artisan.co/ai-sales-agent)\n.\n\n  \n\n### Stage 3: Needs Assessment\n\nMaking a sale is impossible without clearly understanding the new customer’s needs. Fortunately, there’s a great way to find that information during initial and ongoing meetings. \n\n  \n\nOnce you’ve identified, prospected, and qualified a lead, it’s critical to identify their pain points and explain how your solution solves them. \n\n  \n\nSome more effective ways to get leads to open up about pain points include:\n\n  \n\n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    Using open-ended questions to provoke thoughtful responses. \n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    Using follow-up questions to dig into details of specific challenges.\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    Develop hypothetical scenarios where the customer has to talk about a particular approach or ideal for their organization. \n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    Ask about personal insights alongside quantifiable faces (i.e., “Why do you think X is a problem?”)\n    \n      \n    \n\nYou could also offer a free demo at this juncture. [Hubspot notes](https://blog.hubspot.com/sales/sales-pipeline)\n that prospects are 75% likely to buy at the demo stage. \n\n  \n\n### Stage 4: Proposal Creation\n\nSo, you’ve identified a lead, qualified it, and you have a pretty good grasp of their needs and pain points. If you’re in this far, a buyer will expect a proposal outlining what purchasing might look like. This isn’t just an invoice or a marketing brochure; it’s an in-depth description of what the customer will get and how this customer relationship will unfold. \n\n  \n\nA typical proposal will include some primary sections like:\n\n  \n\n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **An introduction and needs statement t**hat outlines the terms of the relationship and the features and capabilities you are delivering to solve specific problems.\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **A description of the specific solutions, features, functions, or tools** sold or provided to the customer.\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Deliverables** like access to the product, any white-glove or support services, credits, and so on.\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **A timeline for these deliverables**, including immediate next steps.  \n     \n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Pricing, payment terms, and deadlines.**\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Case studies and testimonials** that demonstrate the value of your solution to decision-makers. \n    \n      \n    \n\n### Stage 5: Negotiation with Decision-Makers\n\nIf you have nurtured a prospect this far, congratulations – [leads at the negotiation stage are 90% likely to buy](https://blog.hubspot.com/sales/sales-pipeline)\n. The initial proposal isn’t a final agreement, however. Once it is in the customer's hands, negotiations will likely follow to hammer out specifics and reach a mutually beneficial arrangement. \n\n  \n\nSome of the more critical parts of negotiating with decision-makers include:\n\n  \n\n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    Identifying customer wants and needs and balancing them against your expectations, sales targets, and business goals.\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    Fielding objections and counter-proposals with understanding and flexibility without sacrificing profitability or growth. This will include a strong knowledge of the product and its capabilities.\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    Recognizing where negotiations have stalled and how to keep things moving forward, even if that includes escalation or including other stakeholders. \n    \n      \n    \n\n![Monitor](https://www.artisan.co/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.ctfassets.net%2Fkyprwggh4muz%2F5Qxzgsp0wPXwG12szyZP0G%2F7d080e3738965b22a3db1005487d4ec4%2FMonitor.webp&w=3840&q=75)\n\n### Stage 6: Closing Deals\n\nAll these negotiations lead toward the ultimate goal of closing the deal. However, getting a potential customer to make a final purchasing decision can be just as difficult as the negotiations proceeding with that decision. \n\n  \n\nHow can you close a deal effectively? You can:\n\n  \n\n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Act like the deal is closed (assumptive close)**, ushering the customer toward the adoption and onboarding phase.\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Create urgency (urgency close)** through limited-time deals or a window for accepting a proposal.\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Summarizing (summary close)** all the benefits the customer will experience is a way to highlight your product's positive aspects and keep the process moving.\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Maintain a direct approach (direct close)** and frankly approach the customer with a sense of transparency.\n    \n      \n    \n\n  \n\nNone of these approaches is one-size-fits-all, and you still need to apply common sense and intuition to understand if a lead is ready to buy. \n\n  \n\nSome signs that they want to move to the next stage include \n\n  \n\n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    Forward questions about implementation or budget\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    Discussions about specifics about the final terms of the proposal\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    Providing positive feedback on the proposal or product\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    Seeking a trial or demo of your product and services\n    \n      \n    \n\n### Stage 7: Implementation and Onboarding\n\nThe transition from sales to implementation is a crucial phase that ensures a smooth handover from the sales team to the implementation or customer success team. This phase is vital for maintaining customer satisfaction and ensuring that the promises made during the sales process are effectively delivered. \n\n  \n\nA **handover phase** will include initial kick-off meetings, planning, and expectation-setting. At this point, you’ll most likely cover the finer points of implementation, risk management, and security. \n\n  \n\nNext is **onboarding and training**. Sometimes, onboarding can be automated via online platforms and knowledge repositories. For more advanced training needs, support resources (like customer service and documentation) will complement a more robust engagement with virtual or on-site training programs. \n\n  \n\nFinally, **there’s monitoring to ensure customer success**. This is perhaps the most important part of implementation. You must have the workforce and support that the customer expects in place so that they remain a customer and meet the outcomes you identified during the sales process. \n\n  \n\n### Stage 8: Follow-Up and Support\n\nThe deal is done, and the customer is on board and using the solution. But your work isn’t over. It’s imperative to support that customer so that they get the best service possible. This leads to better feedback, better testimonials and stories, continued revenue, and the potential for future sales through referrals. \n\n  \n\nSupport is a proactive process. Treating customers as important as any other customer is also critical. This includes \n\n  \n\n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Having a dedicated point of contact** for the customer who is regularly available and responsive.\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Conducting proactive outreach** via regular check-ins.\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Automating regular surveys** triggered on specific events that allow customers to provide feedback.\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Using CRM systems** like Artisan that track ongoing interactions and keep records of customer preferences and needs.\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Create feedback loops** by constantly collecting, analyzing, and acting on customer data using your sales team, customer service team, and CRM.\n    \n      \n    \n\n  \n\nThese sales opportunities can be used to cross-sell or up-sell products or services that address existing or emerging customer needs. \n\n  \n\nOptimize Your B2B Sales Pipeline With AI\n----------------------------------------\n\n![AI](https://www.artisan.co/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.ctfassets.net%2Fkyprwggh4muz%2F3cxPxGQ0hL7TkwJRQ2s21P%2F204d67964080b860b4b9a8181196229c%2FAI.webp&w=3840&q=75)\n\n[A Hubspot report](https://offers.hubspot.com/sales-trends-report?hubs_signup-url=blog.hubspot.com%2Fsales%2Fsales-statistics&hubs_signup-cta=HubSpot&hubs_post=blog.hubspot.com%2Fsales%2Fsales-statistics&hubs_post-cta=HubSpot&_ga=2.51143532.45855186.1721953845-849358351.1719888644&_gl=1*1jbt6zv*_gcl_au*MTA4Njg5NTM4NC4xNzE5ODg4NjQ0*_ga*ODQ5MzU4MzUxLjE3MTk4ODg2NDQ.*_ga_LXTM6CQ0XK*MTcyMjAyMTg0Ny45LjAuMTcyMjAyMTg0Ny42MC4wLjA.)\n shows that 32% of salespeople see the volume of emails sent as a sign of productivity.

So, what can you do? Outsourcing can help.\n\n  \n\nIncreasingly, advanced AI is assisting businesses in identifying qualified leads at scale without breaking the bank or overtaxing their employees. In fact, [25% of companies report](https://hatchworks.com/blog/software-development/generative-ai-statistics/)\n **that AI helps fill gaps that exist due to a lack of human capacity and** [43% of representatives](https://sellingsignals.com/lead-generation-statistics/)\n **believe that AI positively impacts their performance.**\n\n  \n![51](https://www.artisan.co/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.ctfassets.net%2Fkyprwggh4muz%2Fej8nG5NwbxAU297HICIqp%2F31cb5de7853b8577c7e2f8414e6819a4%2F51.webp&w=3840&q=75)\n\n_From HubSpot’s 2024 Sales Trends Report_\n\n  \n\nIn 2024, outsourcing will be a key component of lead generation campaigns, with AI assistance and automation becoming the norm. That being said, outsourcing isn’t right for every company.\n\n  \n\nSo, let’s break down the pros and cons of outsourcing lead generation to help you decide if it’s the right choice for your team.\n\n  \n\nTransitioning to Outsourcing: Key Factors to Consider\n-----------------------------------------------------\n\n### Defining Your Outsourcing and In-House Lead Generation Models\n\nSo, should you keep your lead generation process in house or look into outside lead generation services? There’s no one-size-fits all solution.\n\n  \n\nIn-house lead generation offers many benefits, such as:\n\n  \n\n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    More direct control of your company’s vision and brand\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    Increased alignment between sales and marketing, which can deepen your understanding of target audiences\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    Internal teams with built-in knowledge of your company can help better tailor campaigns, draft copy, and produce marketing materials\n    \n      \n    \n\n  \nHowever, maintaining an in-house lead generation team requires significant investments in recruitment, training, technology, ongoing management, and so on.\n\n  \n\n**For small businesses, startups, and others with limited bandwidth, outsourcing can be a gamechanger.**\n\n  \n![52](https://www.artisan.co/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.ctfassets.net%2Fkyprwggh4muz%2F7rXwA8XVcJ36NQ6MnQnsBC%2Fcb996132516b7c9c4d9b063d5785e76d%2F52.webp&w=3840&q=75)\n\n_From McKinsey & Company’s “New B2B Growth Equation”_\n\n  \n\nAdditionally, B2B companies in particular may benefit from lead outsourcing. The B2B market is getting tougher. According to McKinsey, B2B buyers’ expectations [have skyrocketed in recent years](https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/growth-marketing-and-sales/our-insights/the-new-b2b-growth-equation)\n, with consumers demanding more and more personalized experiences.\n\n  \n\nIn a hyper-competitive market, casting a wide net is crucial. However, it’s not an easy task when customers expect a customized shopping experience. Lead outsourcing can help by:\n\n  \n\n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    Specialized agents focus exclusively on finding you quality leads, offloading work from your in-house team\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    Your in-house team can instead spend time crafting personalized sales and marketing campaigns to appeal to buyers one-on-one\n    \n      \n    \n\n**  \nIn a nutshell, outsourcing brings in expertise, scalability, and cost-effectiveness. If your company lacks specific resources, outsourcing agencies have access to advanced tools that allow them to execute targeted campaigns efficiently.**\n\n  \n\nUltimately, the decision between in-house and outsourcing models depends on your unique circumstances and sales and marketing objectives.\n\n  \n\n### Identifying Triggers for Shifting to Outsourcing\n\nLead generation can be a major bottleneck for business growth. Identifying potential customers can take hours of valuable time away from your sales team.\n\n  \n\n**Are your current resources are unable to keep up with your lead generation needs?** Consider the following:\n\n  \n\n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Do you need to scale lead generation quickly?** Lead-gen scalability is notoriously tough, especially without outside help. In an unpredictable market especially, outsourcing allows you to scale lead generation flexibly as circumstances change.\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Do you want to improve the quality of your leads?** When your sales team is responsible for everything from drafting emails to cold calling, they might not have adequate time for lead generation. Outsourcing can help you better connect with your target market, ultimately increasing conversion rates.\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Do you lack internal resources?** Lead generation is time-consuming, especially with an overtaxed team. If your marketing and sales initiatives are struggling to connect with your target audience due to capacity constraints, you may need to bring in outside help.\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Are you looking to reduce costs?** While many people assume outsourcing is pricey, it can actually reduce costs. Leveraging the expertise and technology of specialized agencies eliminates the need for many in-house investments.\n    \n      \n    \n\nPros & Cons of Outsourcing Your Lead Generation\n-----------------------------------------------\n\nWhile outsourcing can help with scalability and give your sales and marketing teams extra expertise and experience, it also means sacrificing some control and dealing with potential communication barriers.\n\n  \n\nLet’s take a quick look at the drawbacks and benefits of outsourcing lead generation.\n\n  \n\n### Pros\n\n#### Expertise and Experience\n\nA good outsourcing partner can bring invaluable knowledge to the table. Rather than focusing on all aspects of the sales funnel, you’re working with individuals hyper-focused on lead generation.\n\n  \n\nService providers focus solely on connecting you with the best potential clients, handing your salespeople those leads most likely to convert.\n\n  \n\n#### Cost-Effective\n\nIt might sound cliche, but outsourcing lead generation often pays for itself when it’s done right.\n\n  \n\nWhen working with a quality agency, outsourcing can improve vital metrics and KPIs while cutting back on costs like recruitment, training, and in-house employees.\n\n  \n\n#### Scalability\n\nAs noted above, lead generation can be a barrier to scaling your sales pipeline. If you don’t have adequate time to devote to lead generation, outreach suffers. **Connecting with lower quality leads is a massive waste of everyone’s time and resources.**\n\n  \n\nOutsourcing lead generation allows you to to easily adjust resources based on demand without needing to internally hire or train staff.\n\n  \n\n#### Quick Implementation\n\nLead generation agencies can get campaigns up and running much faster than in-house teams. The sales process is time consuming. Chances are, your reps have a hundred things on their plate _without_ having to worry about rolling out a lead generation strategy.\n\n  \n\nBut an outsourced team specializing in lead generation? **They have the time** **_and_** **resources to implement lead generation efforts fast.**\n\n  \n\n#### Focus on Core Business\n\nWith lead generation handled by outsiders, your sales team can better focus on core business needs.\n\n  \n\nRather than wasting hours crafting an ideal customer profile and identifying key decision-makers to contact, your sales reps can instead spend time honing their people skills, preparing for calls, fine-tuning marketing efforts, and more.\n\n  \n\n### Cons\n\n#### Less Control\n\nFirst, the obvious – you’re placing a lot of trust in an outside party with lead generation.\n\n  \n\nYou’re relinquishing autonomy in decision-making, campaign execution, data management, and more. You may struggle to keep your brand voice intact when you’re delegating tasks to individuals outside your company.\n\n  \n\n#### Quality Concerns\n\nAn outsourcing company might bring in a ton of sales leads, but are they the right leads for your goals? If you’re working with an outside company with values that don’t align with your own, you might end up with a subpar list of contacts.\n\n  \n\nAdditionally, external agencies sometimes prioritize quantity rather than quality in order to meet contractual quotas.\n\n  \n\n#### Communication Barriers\n\nEffective communication is essential for a good lead generation strategy, but unfortunately this doesn’t always go smoothly. Factors like geographic distance, time zone differences, and even small cultural nuances can impede effective collaboration.\n\n  \n\nWhen looking for an outsourcing company, prioritize finding a company with values that mesh with your own and be proactive about facilitating conversation.\n\n  \n\n#### Data Security\n\nLet’s be honest – trust is paramount when you’re outsourcing any aspect of your business’s operations. Outsourcing requires sharing sensitive customer data with external agencies, which naturally raises concerns about data security.\n\n  \n\nHanding over data to third parties can increase the risk of security breaches, impacting your company’s reputation.\n\n  \n\n#### Dependency\n\nIntentional or not, outsourcing can create over-dependence on external agencies. **This is a huge strategic risk for businesses.**\n\n  \n\nRelying _too much_ on a third party can limit the development of your internal team, hindering innovation in lead generation over time. Not to mention that if your outsourcing partnership dissolves for any reason, you may be left scrambling to fill the gaps.\n\n  \n\nChoosing the Right Lead Generation Partner\n------------------------------------------\n\nThe above drawbacks shouldn’t scare you away from outsourcing lead generation. Rather, they should give you a better sense of how to choose the right partner.\n\n  \n\nBelow are a few things to consider when picking an agency to collaborate with.\n\n  \n\n### Industry Knowledge and Expertise\n\n**Does an outsourcing company have experience finding leads from your niche or industry?** If not, they’re unlikely to be the right partner for your team.\n\n  \n\nIdeally, you should look for companies with experience working in your specific industry so they understand the messaging most likely to resonate with high-quality leads.\n\n  \n\nLook for hard proof a company is successful in your industry. Case studies, customer reviews, and hard metrics can help you determine if a company’s worth the investment.\n\n  \n\n### Transparency of Strategies\n\nYou want to work with a company that is dedicated to transparency when it comes to lead generation. Vague content marketing materials claiming to yield a high number of leads don’t tell you much.\n\n  \n\nInstead, look for specifics:\n\n  \n\n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    Are companies being upfront not only about their results but how they achieved them?\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    Are they showing off materials like email marketing templates, LinkedIn posts, outreach strategies, and more to prove they can connect with your ICP?\n    \n      \n    \n\n### Customized Solutions\n\nThe best outsourcing companies understand there aren’t one-size-fits all methods. **Companies should offer customized solutions that work for not only your specific industry but your company’s individual goals and needs.**\n\n  \n\nB2B lead generation strategies differ vastly from the B2C or D2C sector, for example. You don’t want a partner who’s a one-trick pony.\n\n  \n\nThe best partners:\n\n  \n\n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    Take time to understand your target audience, brand voice, and brand goals\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    Have demonstrable experience working with a variety of businesses\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    Have delivered solid results across a diverse range of sectors\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    Look beyond conventional lead generation methods and prioritize cutting-edge technologies and out-of-the-box marketing strategies.\n    \n      \n    \n\n### Lead Quality and Conversion Potential\n\nYou want a partner that prioritizes quality over quantity (albeit, while also bringing in a high number of leads). A good lead generation partner should have a history of helping companies identify leads with needs that align closely with their offerings.\n\n  \n\nIt’s not always easy to immediately gauge an outsourcing company’s skill here. Obviously, reviews that mention quality leads are a great sign, but look into harder metrics too:\n\n  \n\n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    Can a company provide you information about their lead scoring methodologies?\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    If you ask hyper-specific questions about your industry during initial consultations, can company representatives answer easily?\n    \n      \n    \n\n  \nAsking these questions ensures a company has the expertise necessary to track down quality leads with high conversion potential.\n\n  \n\n### Clear Contract and Pricing Models\n\nWe hate to sound like a broken record, but a good lead generation partnership boils down to trust. **A good partner will be completely transparent about their contract and pricing models.** This ensures mutual understanding of your goals, prevents misunderstandings or disagreements, and helps foster a streamlined process for all parties involved.\n\n  \n\nA good outsourcing company should:\n\n  \n\n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    Clearly outline deliverables, timelines, and the respective responsibilities of both parties\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    List pricing models both in the contract _and_ on the company website\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    Let you know _exactly_ what you’re paying for, whether it’s a fixed fee or a performance-based arrangement\n    \n      \n    \n\n### Compliance with Data Privacy Models\n\nCompliance with privacy laws is non-negotiable. The costs can be devastating to both your company’s reputation _and_ revenue. **According to** **_Harvard Business Review,_** **publicly traded companies suffer an average** [7.5% decrease in stock value post-data breach](https://hbr.org/2023/05/the-devastating-business-impacts-of-a-cyber-breach)\n **and audit fees for companies are 13.5% higher post-data breach.**\n\n  \n\nWhen you’re handing over data to a third party, you need to ensure they’re up-to-date with all regulations and have a solid plan in place to ensure customer privacy:\n\n  \n\n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    Does your partner have a clear understanding of national, international, and regional regulations?\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    Can they provide you with detailed information about their data handling practices and security measures?\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    Are they transparent on their website about these procedures?\n    \n      \n    \n\n### Proven Track Record\n\nCan your outsourcing partner put their money where their mouth is? Anyone can make vague claims about their abilities, but you’ll need to see hard facts before committing. Scan a company’s website and social media to see what materials they have speaking to their efficacy.\n\n  \n\nThe more concrete, measurable details the better:\n\n  \n\n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    Can a company provide you with client testimonials, references, and performance metrics?\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    Do they have a history of long-term partnerships?\n    \n      \n    \n\n  \nYou want to work with a company that has a consistent, documented history of delivering results over time and keeping customers happy.\n\n  \n\nHow Much Does It Cost to Outsource Lead Generation?\n---------------------------------------------------\n\nObviously, cost is a huge factor for companies considering outsourcing lead generation. So, let’s take a look at how to estimate costs to help you decide if outsourcing is a feasible option.\n\n  \n\n### Cost Per Lead\n\nCost Per Lead (CPL) [varies greatly by industry](https://www.unboundb2b.com/blog/outsourcing-lead-generation/)\n. **Technology and healthcare fall on the higher end of the spectrum, with averages of $208 and $162 respectively. Retail and non-profits, on the other hand, can fall as low as $34 and $31 respectively.**\n\n  \n\n### Pricing Models\n\nEvery agency will have [their own pricing mode](https://salesroads.com/outsourcing/sales-outsourcing-pricing/)\nl.\n\n  \n\nSome charge hourly rates, **usually falling between $25 to $50 per hour.** Some charge pay-per-performance, where you’re only charged for booked appointments.\n\n  \n\nCosts here can vary a lot by company. **Some companies, usually those that offer customized solutions, work on a retainer basis with fees that start around $8,000.**\n\n  \n\n### Average Cost\n\nAcross all industries, **the average CPL comes to** [around $198](https://www.unboundb2b.com/blog/outsourcing-lead-generation/)\n**.** However, as stated, some industries are pricier than others. Additionally, high-quality verified leads tend to cost more.\n\n  \n\n### Factors Influencing Cost\n\nIt’s hard to make blanket claims about the cost of lead generation. Individual factors make a huge difference. **Everything from the complexity of your campaign to the level of industry competition to your project size impacts your final pricing.**\n\n  \n\nUsing AI Sales Agents like [Ava from Artisan AI](/ai-sales-agent)\n can hugely cut back on costs, with fees starting at just $225 per month.

That being said, outsourcing isn’t right for every company.\n\n  \n\nSo, let’s break down the pros and cons of outsourcing lead generation to help you decide if it’s the right choice for your team.\n\n  \n\nTransitioning to Outsourcing: Key Factors to Consider\n-----------------------------------------------------\n\n### Defining Your Outsourcing and In-House Lead Generation Models\n\nSo, should you keep your lead generation process in house or look into outside lead generation services? There’s no one-size-fits all solution.\n\n  \n\nIn-house lead generation offers many benefits, such as:\n\n  \n\n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    More direct control of your company’s vision and brand\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    Increased alignment between sales and marketing, which can deepen your understanding of target audiences\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    Internal teams with built-in knowledge of your company can help better tailor campaigns, draft copy, and produce marketing materials\n    \n      \n    \n\n  \nHowever, maintaining an in-house lead generation team requires significant investments in recruitment, training, technology, ongoing management, and so on.\n\n  \n\n**For small businesses, startups, and others with limited bandwidth, outsourcing can be a gamechanger.**\n\n  \n![52](https://www.artisan.co/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.ctfassets.net%2Fkyprwggh4muz%2F7rXwA8XVcJ36NQ6MnQnsBC%2Fcb996132516b7c9c4d9b063d5785e76d%2F52.webp&w=3840&q=75)\n\n_From McKinsey & Company’s “New B2B Growth Equation”_\n\n  \n\nAdditionally, B2B companies in particular may benefit from lead outsourcing. The B2B market is getting tougher. According to McKinsey, B2B buyers’ expectations [have skyrocketed in recent years](https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/growth-marketing-and-sales/our-insights/the-new-b2b-growth-equation)\n, with consumers demanding more and more personalized experiences.\n\n  \n\nIn a hyper-competitive market, casting a wide net is crucial. However, it’s not an easy task when customers expect a customized shopping experience. Lead outsourcing can help by:\n\n  \n\n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    Specialized agents focus exclusively on finding you quality leads, offloading work from your in-house team\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    Your in-house team can instead spend time crafting personalized sales and marketing campaigns to appeal to buyers one-on-one\n    \n      \n    \n\n**  \nIn a nutshell, outsourcing brings in expertise, scalability, and cost-effectiveness. If your company lacks specific resources, outsourcing agencies have access to advanced tools that allow them to execute targeted campaigns efficiently.**\n\n  \n\nUltimately, the decision between in-house and outsourcing models depends on your unique circumstances and sales and marketing objectives.\n\n  \n\n### Identifying Triggers for Shifting to Outsourcing\n\nLead generation can be a major bottleneck for business growth. Identifying potential customers can take hours of valuable time away from your sales team.\n\n  \n\n**Are your current resources are unable to keep up with your lead generation needs?** Consider the following:\n\n  \n\n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Do you need to scale lead generation quickly?** Lead-gen scalability is notoriously tough, especially without outside help. In an unpredictable market especially, outsourcing allows you to scale lead generation flexibly as circumstances change.\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Do you want to improve the quality of your leads?** When your sales team is responsible for everything from drafting emails to cold calling, they might not have adequate time for lead generation. Outsourcing can help you better connect with your target market, ultimately increasing conversion rates.\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Do you lack internal resources?** Lead generation is time-consuming, especially with an overtaxed team. If your marketing and sales initiatives are struggling to connect with your target audience due to capacity constraints, you may need to bring in outside help.\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Are you looking to reduce costs?** While many people assume outsourcing is pricey, it can actually reduce costs. Leveraging the expertise and technology of specialized agencies eliminates the need for many in-house investments.\n    \n      \n    \n\nPros & Cons of Outsourcing Your Lead Generation\n-----------------------------------------------\n\nWhile outsourcing can help with scalability and give your sales and marketing teams extra expertise and experience, it also means sacrificing some control and dealing with potential communication barriers.\n\n  \n\nLet’s take a quick look at the drawbacks and benefits of outsourcing lead generation.\n\n  \n\n### Pros\n\n#### Expertise and Experience\n\nA good outsourcing partner can bring invaluable knowledge to the table. Rather than focusing on all aspects of the sales funnel, you’re working with individuals hyper-focused on lead generation.\n\n  \n\nService providers focus solely on connecting you with the best potential clients, handing your salespeople those leads most likely to convert.\n\n  \n\n#### Cost-Effective\n\nIt might sound cliche, but outsourcing lead generation often pays for itself when it’s done right.\n\n  \n\nWhen working with a quality agency, outsourcing can improve vital metrics and KPIs while cutting back on costs like recruitment, training, and in-house employees.\n\n  \n\n#### Scalability\n\nAs noted above, lead generation can be a barrier to scaling your sales pipeline. If you don’t have adequate time to devote to lead generation, outreach suffers. **Connecting with lower quality leads is a massive waste of everyone’s time and resources.**\n\n  \n\nOutsourcing lead generation allows you to to easily adjust resources based on demand without needing to internally hire or train staff.\n\n  \n\n#### Quick Implementation\n\nLead generation agencies can get campaigns up and running much faster than in-house teams. The sales process is time consuming. Chances are, your reps have a hundred things on their plate _without_ having to worry about rolling out a lead generation strategy.\n\n  \n\nBut an outsourced team specializing in lead generation? **They have the time** **_and_** **resources to implement lead generation efforts fast.**\n\n  \n\n#### Focus on Core Business\n\nWith lead generation handled by outsiders, your sales team can better focus on core business needs.\n\n  \n\nRather than wasting hours crafting an ideal customer profile and identifying key decision-makers to contact, your sales reps can instead spend time honing their people skills, preparing for calls, fine-tuning marketing efforts, and more.\n\n  \n\n### Cons\n\n#### Less Control\n\nFirst, the obvious – you’re placing a lot of trust in an outside party with lead generation.\n\n  \n\nYou’re relinquishing autonomy in decision-making, campaign execution, data management, and more. You may struggle to keep your brand voice intact when you’re delegating tasks to individuals outside your company.\n\n  \n\n#### Quality Concerns\n\nAn outsourcing company might bring in a ton of sales leads, but are they the right leads for your goals? If you’re working with an outside company with values that don’t align with your own, you might end up with a subpar list of contacts.\n\n  \n\nAdditionally, external agencies sometimes prioritize quantity rather than quality in order to meet contractual quotas.\n\n  \n\n#### Communication Barriers\n\nEffective communication is essential for a good lead generation strategy, but unfortunately this doesn’t always go smoothly. Factors like geographic distance, time zone differences, and even small cultural nuances can impede effective collaboration.\n\n  \n\nWhen looking for an outsourcing company, prioritize finding a company with values that mesh with your own and be proactive about facilitating conversation.\n\n  \n\n#### Data Security\n\nLet’s be honest – trust is paramount when you’re outsourcing any aspect of your business’s operations. Outsourcing requires sharing sensitive customer data with external agencies, which naturally raises concerns about data security.\n\n  \n\nHanding over data to third parties can increase the risk of security breaches, impacting your company’s reputation.\n\n  \n\n#### Dependency\n\nIntentional or not, outsourcing can create over-dependence on external agencies. **This is a huge strategic risk for businesses.**\n\n  \n\nRelying _too much_ on a third party can limit the development of your internal team, hindering innovation in lead generation over time. Not to mention that if your outsourcing partnership dissolves for any reason, you may be left scrambling to fill the gaps.\n\n  \n\nChoosing the Right Lead Generation Partner\n------------------------------------------\n\nThe above drawbacks shouldn’t scare you away from outsourcing lead generation. Rather, they should give you a better sense of how to choose the right partner.\n\n  \n\nBelow are a few things to consider when picking an agency to collaborate with.\n\n  \n\n### Industry Knowledge and Expertise\n\n**Does an outsourcing company have experience finding leads from your niche or industry?** If not, they’re unlikely to be the right partner for your team.\n\n  \n\nIdeally, you should look for companies with experience working in your specific industry so they understand the messaging most likely to resonate with high-quality leads.\n\n  \n\nLook for hard proof a company is successful in your industry. Case studies, customer reviews, and hard metrics can help you determine if a company’s worth the investment.\n\n  \n\n### Transparency of Strategies\n\nYou want to work with a company that is dedicated to transparency when it comes to lead generation. Vague content marketing materials claiming to yield a high number of leads don’t tell you much.\n\n  \n\nInstead, look for specifics:\n\n  \n\n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    Are companies being upfront not only about their results but how they achieved them?\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    Are they showing off materials like email marketing templates, LinkedIn posts, outreach strategies, and more to prove they can connect with your ICP?\n    \n      \n    \n\n### Customized Solutions\n\nThe best outsourcing companies understand there aren’t one-size-fits all methods. **Companies should offer customized solutions that work for not only your specific industry but your company’s individual goals and needs.**\n\n  \n\nB2B lead generation strategies differ vastly from the B2C or D2C sector, for example. You don’t want a partner who’s a one-trick pony.\n\n  \n\nThe best partners:\n\n  \n\n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    Take time to understand your target audience, brand voice, and brand goals\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    Have demonstrable experience working with a variety of businesses\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    Have delivered solid results across a diverse range of sectors\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    Look beyond conventional lead generation methods and prioritize cutting-edge technologies and out-of-the-box marketing strategies.\n    \n      \n    \n\n### Lead Quality and Conversion Potential\n\nYou want a partner that prioritizes quality over quantity (albeit, while also bringing in a high number of leads). A good lead generation partner should have a history of helping companies identify leads with needs that align closely with their offerings.\n\n  \n\nIt’s not always easy to immediately gauge an outsourcing company’s skill here. Obviously, reviews that mention quality leads are a great sign, but look into harder metrics too:\n\n  \n\n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    Can a company provide you information about their lead scoring methodologies?\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    If you ask hyper-specific questions about your industry during initial consultations, can company representatives answer easily?\n    \n      \n    \n\n  \nAsking these questions ensures a company has the expertise necessary to track down quality leads with high conversion potential.\n\n  \n\n### Clear Contract and Pricing Models\n\nWe hate to sound like a broken record, but a good lead generation partnership boils down to trust. **A good partner will be completely transparent about their contract and pricing models.** This ensures mutual understanding of your goals, prevents misunderstandings or disagreements, and helps foster a streamlined process for all parties involved.\n\n  \n\nA good outsourcing company should:\n\n  \n\n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    Clearly outline deliverables, timelines, and the respective responsibilities of both parties\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    List pricing models both in the contract _and_ on the company website\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    Let you know _exactly_ what you’re paying for, whether it’s a fixed fee or a performance-based arrangement\n    \n      \n    \n\n### Compliance with Data Privacy Models\n\nCompliance with privacy laws is non-negotiable. The costs can be devastating to both your company’s reputation _and_ revenue. **According to** **_Harvard Business Review,_** **publicly traded companies suffer an average** [7.5% decrease in stock value post-data breach](https://hbr.org/2023/05/the-devastating-business-impacts-of-a-cyber-breach)\n **and audit fees for companies are 13.5% higher post-data breach.**\n\n  \n\nWhen you’re handing over data to a third party, you need to ensure they’re up-to-date with all regulations and have a solid plan in place to ensure customer privacy:\n\n  \n\n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    Does your partner have a clear understanding of national, international, and regional regulations?\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    Can they provide you with detailed information about their data handling practices and security measures?\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    Are they transparent on their website about these procedures?\n    \n      \n    \n\n### Proven Track Record\n\nCan your outsourcing partner put their money where their mouth is? Anyone can make vague claims about their abilities, but you’ll need to see hard facts before committing. Scan a company’s website and social media to see what materials they have speaking to their efficacy.\n\n  \n\nThe more concrete, measurable details the better:\n\n  \n\n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    Can a company provide you with client testimonials, references, and performance metrics?\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    Do they have a history of long-term partnerships?\n    \n      \n    \n\n  \nYou want to work with a company that has a consistent, documented history of delivering results over time and keeping customers happy.\n\n  \n\nHow Much Does It Cost to Outsource Lead Generation?\n---------------------------------------------------\n\nObviously, cost is a huge factor for companies considering outsourcing lead generation. So, let’s take a look at how to estimate costs to help you decide if outsourcing is a feasible option.\n\n  \n\n### Cost Per Lead\n\nCost Per Lead (CPL) [varies greatly by industry](https://www.unboundb2b.com/blog/outsourcing-lead-generation/)\n. **Technology and healthcare fall on the higher end of the spectrum, with averages of $208 and $162 respectively. Retail and non-profits, on the other hand, can fall as low as $34 and $31 respectively.**\n\n  \n\n### Pricing Models\n\nEvery agency will have [their own pricing mode](https://salesroads.com/outsourcing/sales-outsourcing-pricing/)\nl.\n\n  \n\nSome charge hourly rates, **usually falling between $25 to $50 per hour.** Some charge pay-per-performance, where you’re only charged for booked appointments.\n\n  \n\nCosts here can vary a lot by company. **Some companies, usually those that offer customized solutions, work on a retainer basis with fees that start around $8,000.**\n\n  \n\n### Average Cost\n\nAcross all industries, **the average CPL comes to** [around $198](https://www.unboundb2b.com/blog/outsourcing-lead-generation/)\n**.** However, as stated, some industries are pricier than others. Additionally, high-quality verified leads tend to cost more.\n\n  \n\n### Factors Influencing Cost\n\nIt’s hard to make blanket claims about the cost of lead generation. Individual factors make a huge difference. **Everything from the complexity of your campaign to the level of industry competition to your project size impacts your final pricing.**\n\n  \n\nUsing AI Sales Agents like [Ava from Artisan AI](/ai-sales-agent)\n can hugely cut back on costs, with fees starting at just $225 per month.

To measure the success of your outsourced lead generation efforts, consider these key performance indicators (KPIs) and methods:\n\n  \n\n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Cost Per Lead (CPL):** Calculate the cost spent on the campaign divided by the number of leads generated to measure efficiency and budget alignment.\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Lead Conversion Rate:** Track the percentage of leads that become qualified prospects and then customers, indicating the quality of leads.\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Return on Investment (ROI):** Assess the revenue generated from the leads compared to the cost of the outsourcing service to determine profitability.\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Sales Growth:** Monitor any increases in sales volume that correlate with the start of the lead generation campaign, indicating overall effectiveness.\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Customer Lifetime Value (CLV):** Measure the revenue a customer is expected to generate throughout their relationship with your company, indicating long-term value from leads.\n    \n      \n    \n\nThe Best Services and Companies to Outsource Lead Generation in 2024\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n### Artisan AI\n\n![53](https://www.artisan.co/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.ctfassets.net%2Fkyprwggh4muz%2F7kKF2bO0JJGZEGKYh404uc%2Fa4999be537e6591c5c3ce84b33ecb20f%2F53.webp&w=3840&q=75)\n\nArtisan AI specializes in creating AI employees, called Artisans, capable of automating entire workflows.

Ranked among the market leaders in numerous categories on G2, there’s no doubt it’s a powerful platform.  \n\n  \n\nBut it’s not without its drawbacks. \n\n  \n\nWhatever your reasons for searching for an alternative, whether it’s Apollo’s price, complex dashboard and steep learning curve, lead data accuracy, or limited AI functionality, we’ve got your back. \n\n  \n\nWe’ve covered the top alternatives to Apollo, from enterprise-level market leaders like ZoomInfo to fresh-off-the-line, AI-first companies like Artisan.\n\n  \n\nAnd don’t worry, we’re not going to make it all about comparing the sizes of databases.

Unlike the other entries on this list, AI is baked right into the core of the software in a very nuanced and wide-reaching way. \n\n  \n\nArtisan’s AI engine is a human-like “employee” called Ava. She’s a virtual business development representative (BDR) who can automate 80% of the outbound sales process and will get your first campaign up and running over the course of a 10-minute conversation. \n\n  \n\nAva puts together your ideal customer profile, prospects the Artisan database of over 300 million contacts, filters and enriches the leads, and crafts and sends bespoke email sequences.\n\n  \n\nYou can also, of course, access features manually where appropriate and have full control over what’s automated.\n\n  \n![Ava for Apollo](https://www.artisan.co/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.ctfassets.net%2Fkyprwggh4muz%2F2ZnS0QSbrGWM95zT0rbxV%2F83478b5bc6f3a267fd151b2e6919e124%2F4.webp&w=3840&q=75)\n\n### Key Features\n\n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Baked-in AI engine.** Artisan’s AI sales development representative (SDR), Ava, streamlines and improves every part of the outbound sales process, from campaign setup to the actual outreach itself. \n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Lead database.** Apollo’s database has over 300 million leads across 200 countries with up-to-date and fully enriched lead data. \n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Web scraping.** Ava collects data points from a wide set of sources, including company websites and social media like LinkedIn and Twitter. \n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Workflow replication.** Already have successful outbound sales workflows? Excellent. Ava can replicate and automate them in Artisan by building a dedicated playbook for your target outreach and email sequences. \n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Email automation.** Artisan’s email outreach tools are fully automated, with timezone tracking, translation, bounce testing, and dynamic send limits baked in. Send follow-up emails, receive notifications about interested leads, and manage responses via the intuitive email dashboard. \n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Email warmup.** Built-in email warmup service ensures that your mailboxes are prepped and ready to go without fear of penalties. No need to pay for a dedicated third-party warmup service. \n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Analytics.** You’ll have access to comprehensive data about your campaigns with metrics like lead response rate, mailbox health, most successful campaigns, and more. \n    \n      \n    \n\n![Ava-Apollo-5](https://www.artisan.co/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.ctfassets.net%2Fkyprwggh4muz%2F5nXKlYy1QssFZBASR9OY1s%2F9a20d4c40833038dbed95104161d7d83%2F5.webp&w=3840&q=75)\n\n### Pricing\n\nArtisan pricing varies based on the lead volume and customization required. However, you’ll get one-on-one onboarding, and there’s no charge until your campaign is firing on all cylinders (so you’re not worrying about idle time). \n\n  \n\nFor a pricing consultation and to learn how Ava can boost your sales enablement, reach out to Artisan’s sales team.\n\n  \n\n### Pros\n\n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    Uses active web scraping and AI enrichment to identify a wide range of lead data points including intent and technographic data\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    Comprehensive platform for all aspects of sales outreach\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    Automation for every stage of your outbound workflow\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    Automates email writing based on successful email playbooks and emulation of true human style\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    Built-in hallucination checks to prevent AI-related mistakes\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    At the forefront of AI to create hyper-personalized research, enrichment, and outreach workflows\n    \n      \n    \n\n### Cons\n\n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    As an early-stage startup, some features are missing (though Artisan is growing very quickly, and new functionality is being added weekly)\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    Expensive for smaller companies compared to more basic automation software\n    \n      \n    \n\n2\\.

It seems that nowadays, no software review is complete without HubSpot getting at least a passing mention. \n\n  \n\nSales Hub is a standalone solution (although it does, of course, integrate with the HubSpot CRM) and has pricing tiers that cater to the whole spectrum of business users, from solopreneurs to multinational enterprises. \n\n  \n\n### Key features\n\n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Sales engagement sequences.** Build and automate email outreach sequences. \n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Lead scoring.** Score and track the progress of your leads. \n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **CRM integration.** Integrate Sales Hub easily with your HubSpot CRM if you use it. \n    \n      \n    \n\n### Pricing\n\nHubspot has three pricing tiers and a free plan. The “Starter” package is **$20/month per user**, the “Professional” package is **$100/month per user**, and the “Enterprise” package is **$150/month** per user. \n\n  \n\n### Pros\n\n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    Integrates directly with the broader HubSpot CRM\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    Includes a meeting scheduler and invoicing tools \n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    Easy-to-use platform and large community   \n    \n      \n    \n\n### Cons\n\n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    No lead database \n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    AI functionality is limited to writing emails\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    Per-user pricing can quickly add up \n    \n      \n    \n\n4\\. LinkedIn Sales Navigator\n----------------------------\n\n![LinkedIn Sales](https://www.artisan.co/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.ctfassets.net%2Fkyprwggh4muz%2F3TUUXBsBvJszciW6TQrReG%2F9f7681d2a69d2ecb2bd411554d98c77b%2FScreenshot__690_.png&w=3840&q=75)\n\nLinkedIn Sales Navigator is one of the most popular sales prospecting tools, largely by virtue of the fact LinkedIn can advertise to virtually every sales professional on the planet. \n\n  \n\nAutomation features are limited, and, perhaps counterintuitively, its database is relatively small compared to other providers because it only provides access to individuals and companies with profiles. \n\n  \n\n### Key features\n\n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Lead database.** Access a database of around 60 million LinkedIn users. \n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Intent tracking.** Filter leads based on signals like job changes and profile visits. \n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Integrations library.** Integrate with top CRMs like HubSpot and Salesforce. \n    \n      \n    \n\n### Pricing\n\nSales Navigator “Core” costs **$99/month,** and Sales Navigator “Advanced” costs **$169.99/month**.

It’s garnering a reputation as a solid source of email contact data—with rigorous email verification criteria—but has mixed reviews when it comes to phone numbers. \n\n  \n\n### Key features\n\n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Lead database:** Prospect from a database of 50 million enterprise accounts, with many GDPR-compliant leads. \n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Intent filter.** Track intent and lead readiness with behavioral data. \n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Workflow automation.** Automate email sequences and lead identification. \n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **LinkedIn browser extension.** Prospect from LinkedIn while browsing. \n    \n      \n    \n\n### Pricing\n\nLusha has two paid tiers in addition to free and custom plans. The “Pro” plan is **$49/month** per user, and the “Premium” plan is **$79/month** per user. \n\n  \n\n### Pros\n\n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    Transparent pricing for smaller companies \n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    Emphasis on GDPR-compliant data \n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    Simple and intuitive platform\n    \n      \n    \n\n### Cons\n\n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    Phone data requires credits\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    Few segmentation features\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    Lack of AI functionality\n    \n      \n    \n\n6\\. Seamless.AI\n---------------\n\n![Seamless.AI](https://www.artisan.co/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.ctfassets.net%2Fkyprwggh4muz%2F4sTfWwrH1eidqzOGs9wWHg%2F267457767137048e5bf6162f6e4655e0%2FScreenshot__692_.png&w=3840&q=75)\n\nSeamless.AI places AI functionality at the core of its platform, using it to verify and enrich B2B contact data and lead lists and automate cold email outreach. \n\n  \n\nIt works on a lead credit basis, so there will be limits on how much outreach you can conduct if you opt for Seamless.AI. \n\n  \n\n### **Key features**\n\n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **AI-enriched lead database.** Access a large database of prospects with AI-enriched data. \n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Workflow automation.** Send automated email outreach and follow-up with emails written by AI.\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Lead search engine.** Search directly for leads using the prospect “real-time search engine.”\n    \n      \n    \n\n### Pricing\n\nSeamless.AI offers a free trial with 50 credits.

User reviews indicate that pricing starts at approximately **$150/month**.  \n\n  \n\n### Pros\n\n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    Strong AI functionality\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    Automation tools for email sequences\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    Lead search engine for finding individual sales leads\n    \n      \n    \n\n### Cons\n\n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    Credit-based structure, which can restrict outreach\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    Limited customer support on “Basic” plan\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    Many advanced features like intent signals are only available on the “Pro” plan and above\n    \n      \n    \n\n7\\. Hunter\n----------\n\n![Hunter](https://www.artisan.co/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.ctfassets.net%2Fkyprwggh4muz%2F5Z4JabrLAXzZGoZNPOOGDz%2F46a0bb8850bd0b7ae82193b1655d066d%2FScreenshot__693_.png&w=3840&q=75)\n\nEmail is Hunter’s thing. It’s a good Apollo’s alternative but focused on near-exclusively email, with little additional lead data. \n\n  \n\nWhile Hunter does have discovery and prospecting features, it’s better understood as an email finder rather than a sales outreach one. It’s a potential option for smaller businesses without complex prospecting requirements. \n\n  \n\n### Key features\n\n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Email search tool.** Search for email addresses at target companies and run email verification. \n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Campaign automation.** Run semi-automated email campaigns on the platform. \n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Integrations.** Integrate with the most popular CRMs and use the browser extension to enhance prospecting. \n    \n      \n    \n\n### Pricing\n\nHunter has a free plan with 25/searches per month. The “Starter” plan is **$49.00/month**, the “Growth” plan is **$149/month**, and the “Business” plan is **$499/month**. Hunter also has an enterprise tier. \n\n  \n\n### Pros\n\n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    Good email data accuracy\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    Unlimited users (limits are based on monthly searches)\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    Browser add-on\n    \n      \n    \n\n### Cons\n\n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    No phone data\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    Restrictions on the number of email searches per month\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    Limited automation and AI features\n    \n      \n    \n\n8\\. RocketReach\n---------------\n\n![RocketReach](https://www.artisan.co/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.ctfassets.net%2Fkyprwggh4muz%2F1eVqG3pYcUINUtcHBqZHy6%2F5a25b225d02b6232002678ecf79efec4%2FScreenshot__694_.png&w=3840&q=75)\n\nRocketReach has a colossal database of 700 million leads and a strong set of lead-generation automation features. \n\n  \n\nThat said, users have raised concerns about the quality of B2B email and direct dials. In addition, to access unlimited data, you need to subscribe to an annual plan. \n\n  \n\n### Key features\n\n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Leads database.** Access a huge database of 700 million leads.\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Intent signals.** Tailor outreach to target individuals with strong buyer intent. \n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **API.** Rocket offers an API for enterprise use. \n    \n      \n    \n\n### Pricing\n\nRocketReach offers a range of pricing tiers from **$39.00/month** (individual plan) to **$349/month** per user (team plan). You’ll need to purchase an annual plan for unlimited lead data. \n\n  \n\n### Pros\n\n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    Large lead database\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    Well-priced individual plans\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    Email automation\n    \n      \n    \n\n### Cons\n\n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    The database is of questionable quality based on user reviews\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    Forces you to purchase the annual plan to unlock features\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    A limited number of integrations\n    \n      \n    \n\n9\\.

That’s not quite true—other services don’t cap the amount of lead data you can access—but it does have a pretty sizable database of over 450 million. \n\n  \n\nLead411 has added outreach tools for running email campaigns directly to the platform and also offers intent data on its premium plans. \n\n  \n\n### **Key features**\n\n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Unlimited data access.** Gather as much lead data (emails and phone numbers) as you want without any limits. \n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Intent signals.** Track intent signals and score B2B leads (only available on the higher-tier plan). \n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Outreach management.** Run email campaigns on the platform, including SMS outreach.\n    \n      \n    \n\n### Pricing\n\nLead411’s “Basic Plus Unlimited” plan costs **$99/month per user**.

But if you’re looking for fresh leads, you’ll need an additional service that provides access to a database. \n\n  \n\n### Key features\n\n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Outreach management.** Manage leads and run segmented email campaigns.\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Analytics.** Access granular data about your campaigns across a range of metrics like revenue targets and sales team performance. \n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Large library of integrations.** Integrate Pipedrive with your whole tech stack. \n    \n      \n    \n\n### Pricing\n\nPipedrive offers several pricing plans, beginning at **$14/month per user** and ending at **$99/month** **per user**.

Leads are the lifeblood of your business. And the tools you use will make a big difference. \n\n  \n\nAs for parting advice, we recommend taking _full_ advantage of free trials and demos. Oh, and don’t forget to give Artisan a test drive. We know you’ll love it.\n\n  \n\nFrequently Asked Questions (FAQs)\n---------------------------------\n\n**What is Apollo.io?**\n\n  \n\nApollo is a lead prospecting and outreach platform.

Its top features include an extensive lead database and outreach automation tools. \n\n  \n\n**Why consider alternatives to Apollo.io?**\n\n  \n\nAlternatives to Apollo may offer features better suited to your needs. Apollo’s competitors sometimes perform better in terms of database size, AI functionality, ease of use, and pricing, to name some examples. \n\n  \n\n**Which tool is best for small businesses?**\n\n  \n\nHunter, RocketReach, and Lusha all have pricing tiers that will appeal to small businesses.

Unlike the other entries on this list, AI is baked right into the core of the software in a very nuanced and wide-reaching way. \n\n  \n\nArtisan’s AI engine is a human-like “employee” called Ava. She’s a virtual business development representative (BDR) who can automate 80% of the outbound sales process and will get your first campaign up and running over the course of a 10-minute conversation. \n\n  \n\nAva puts together your ideal customer profile, prospects the Artisan database of over 300 million contacts, filters and enriches the leads, and crafts and sends bespoke email sequences.\n\n  \n\nYou can also, of course, access features manually where appropriate and have full control over what’s automated.\n\n  \n![Ava for Apollo](https://www.artisan.co/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.ctfassets.net%2Fkyprwggh4muz%2F2ZnS0QSbrGWM95zT0rbxV%2F83478b5bc6f3a267fd151b2e6919e124%2F4.webp&w=3840&q=75)\n\n### Key Features\n\n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Baked-in AI engine.** Artisan’s AI sales development representative (SDR), Ava, streamlines and improves every part of the outbound sales process, from campaign setup to the actual outreach itself. \n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Lead database.** Apollo’s database has over 300 million leads across 200 countries with up-to-date and fully enriched lead data. \n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Web scraping.** Ava collects data points from a wide set of sources, including company websites and social media like LinkedIn and Twitter. \n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Workflow replication.** Already have successful outbound sales workflows?

User reviews indicate that pricing starts at approximately **$150/month**.  \n\n  \n\n### Pros\n\n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    Strong AI functionality\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    Automation tools for email sequences\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    Lead search engine for finding individual sales leads\n    \n      \n    \n\n### Cons\n\n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    Credit-based structure, which can restrict outreach\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    Limited customer support on “Basic” plan\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    Many advanced features like intent signals are only available on the “Pro” plan and above\n    \n      \n    \n\n7\\. Hunter\n----------\n\n![Hunter](https://www.artisan.co/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.ctfassets.net%2Fkyprwggh4muz%2F5Z4JabrLAXzZGoZNPOOGDz%2F46a0bb8850bd0b7ae82193b1655d066d%2FScreenshot__693_.png&w=3840&q=75)\n\nEmail is Hunter’s thing. It’s a good Apollo’s alternative but focused on near-exclusively email, with little additional lead data. \n\n  \n\nWhile Hunter does have discovery and prospecting features, it’s better understood as an email finder rather than a sales outreach one. It’s a potential option for smaller businesses without complex prospecting requirements. \n\n  \n\n### Key features\n\n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Email search tool.** Search for email addresses at target companies and run email verification. \n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Campaign automation.** Run semi-automated email campaigns on the platform. \n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Integrations.** Integrate with the most popular CRMs and use the browser extension to enhance prospecting. \n    \n      \n    \n\n### Pricing\n\nHunter has a free plan with 25/searches per month. The “Starter” plan is **$49.00/month**, the “Growth” plan is **$149/month**, and the “Business” plan is **$499/month**. Hunter also has an enterprise tier. \n\n  \n\n### Pros\n\n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    Good email data accuracy\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    Unlimited users (limits are based on monthly searches)\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    Browser add-on\n    \n      \n    \n\n### Cons\n\n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    No phone data\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    Restrictions on the number of email searches per month\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    Limited automation and AI features\n    \n      \n    \n\n8\\. RocketReach\n---------------\n\n![RocketReach](https://www.artisan.co/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.ctfassets.net%2Fkyprwggh4muz%2F1eVqG3pYcUINUtcHBqZHy6%2F5a25b225d02b6232002678ecf79efec4%2FScreenshot__694_.png&w=3840&q=75)\n\nRocketReach has a colossal database of 700 million leads and a strong set of lead-generation automation features. \n\n  \n\nThat said, users have raised concerns about the quality of B2B email and direct dials. In addition, to access unlimited data, you need to subscribe to an annual plan. \n\n  \n\n### Key features\n\n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Leads database.** Access a huge database of 700 million leads.\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Intent signals.** Tailor outreach to target individuals with strong buyer intent. \n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **API.** Rocket offers an API for enterprise use. \n    \n      \n    \n\n### Pricing\n\nRocketReach offers a range of pricing tiers from **$39.00/month** (individual plan) to **$349/month** per user (team plan). You’ll need to purchase an annual plan for unlimited lead data. \n\n  \n\n### Pros\n\n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    Large lead database\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    Well-priced individual plans\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    Email automation\n    \n      \n    \n\n### Cons\n\n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    The database is of questionable quality based on user reviews\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    Forces you to purchase the annual plan to unlock features\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    A limited number of integrations\n    \n      \n    \n\n9\\.

That’s not quite true—other services don’t cap the amount of lead data you can access—but it does have a pretty sizable database of over 450 million. \n\n  \n\nLead411 has added outreach tools for running email campaigns directly to the platform and also offers intent data on its premium plans. \n\n  \n\n### **Key features**\n\n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Unlimited data access.** Gather as much lead data (emails and phone numbers) as you want without any limits. \n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Intent signals.** Track intent signals and score B2B leads (only available on the higher-tier plan). \n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Outreach management.** Run email campaigns on the platform, including SMS outreach.\n    \n      \n    \n\n### Pricing\n\nLead411’s “Basic Plus Unlimited” plan costs **$99/month per user**. Intent data is available on the annual “Pro” and “Unlimited” packages. Contact sales for pricing. A free trial is available. \n\n  \n\n### Pros\n\n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    Large database with unlimited access\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    Integrations with top CRMs\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    Chrome extension for prospecting while browsing\n    \n      \n    \n\n### Cons\n\n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    Expensive compared to other Apollo alternatives\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    Small number of integrations compared to other tools\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    Intent data is not available on all plans\n    \n      \n    \n\n10\\.

But if you’re looking for fresh leads, you’ll need an additional service that provides access to a database. \n\n  \n\n### Key features\n\n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Outreach management.** Manage leads and run segmented email campaigns.\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Analytics.** Access granular data about your campaigns across a range of metrics like revenue targets and sales team performance. \n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Large library of integrations.** Integrate Pipedrive with your whole tech stack. \n    \n      \n    \n\n### Pricing\n\nPipedrive offers several pricing plans, beginning at **$14/month per user** and ending at **$99/month** **per user**. All plans have free trials. \n\n  \n\n### Pros\n\n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    Powerful enterprise-level sales enablement platform\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    Growing AI functionality \n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    Lots of integrations\n    \n      \n    \n\n### Cons\n\n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    It doesn’t provide access to a lead database\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    Slightly convoluted pricing structure\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    Intuitive and well-designed interface\n    \n      \n    \n\nIt’s time to say goodbye…\n-------------------------\n\nWe get it. Wading through sales enablement platforms is hard work. Learning to navigate different dashboards is time-consuming and frustrating. But it _is_ worth it. \n\n  \n![Apollo Alternatives-2](https://www.artisan.co/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.ctfassets.net%2Fkyprwggh4muz%2F1B94fTEXazeOSoGpC0lDu8%2Fa909b260d886e56d4442b5d72707ef6e%2F3.webp&w=3840&q=75)\n\nThe hours you devote to picking the right tool—one that’s ideally suited to your and your team’s specific needs—is time well spent. Leads are the lifeblood of your business. And the tools you use will make a big difference. \n\n  \n\nAs for parting advice, we recommend taking _full_ advantage of free trials and demos. Oh, and don’t forget to give Artisan a test drive. We know you’ll love it.\n\n  \n\nFrequently Asked Questions (FAQs)\n---------------------------------\n\n**What is Apollo.io?**\n\n  \n\nApollo is a lead prospecting and outreach platform. Its user base has grown substantially over the last several years and is now a market leader. Its top features include an extensive lead database and outreach automation tools. \n\n  \n\n**Why consider alternatives to Apollo.io?**\n\n  \n\nAlternatives to Apollo may offer features better suited to your needs. Apollo’s competitors sometimes perform better in terms of database size, AI functionality, ease of use, and pricing, to name some examples. \n\n  \n\n**Which tool is best for small businesses?**\n\n  \n\nHunter, RocketReach, and Lusha all have pricing tiers that will appeal to small businesses. HubSpot Sales Hub is also a good option but doesn’t provide lead data. \n\n  \n\n**How to evaluate sales automation tools?**\n\n  \n\nTo evaluate sales automation tools, take full advantage of free trials, check the quality of the lead database by conducting your own searches, check user reviews, and don’t hesitate to contact support with questions. \n\n  \n\nShare Article\n\n![copy-link](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/copy-link.svg)[![copy-link](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/mail.svg)](mailto:?body=https://www.artisan.co/blog/apollo-alternatives)\n\nYou might also like\n-------------------\n\nReady to Supercharge Your Outbound?\n-----------------------------------\n\nOur AI-first platform equips your team with best-in-class outbound tools and our AI BDR Ava, who automates your entire outbound workflow.\n\nPhone\n\nGet Started\n\n### Products\n\n*   [Artisan Sales Overview](/sales-ai)\n    \n*   [Ava, the AI Sales Agent](/ai-sales-agent)\n    \n*   [B2B Data](/products/b2b-data)\n    \n*   [Sales Playbooks](/products/sales-playbooks)\n    \n*   [Email Warmup](/products/email-warmup)\n    \n*   [Sales Automation](/products/sales-automation)\n    \n\n### Resources\n\n*   [Blog](/blog)\n    \n*   [Demos](/watch-demo)\n    \n*   [Support](https://support.artisan.co/)\n    \n*   [Case Studies](/casestudies)\n    \n*   ChangelogSoon\n    \n\n### Solutions\n\n*   [Enterprise](/solutions/enterprise)\n    \n*   [Midmarket](/solutions/midmarket)\n    \n*   [Startups](/solutions/startups)\n    \n*   Lead Gen AgenciesSoon\n    \n\n### Company\n\n*   [About Us](/about)\n    \n*   [Contact Us](/contact-us)\n    \n*   [Careers](/careers)\n    \n*   Artisan LabsSoon\n    \n\n![artisan-logo](https://www.artisan.co/_next/image?url=%2Fassets%2Flogo.webp&w=384&q=75)\n\n© 2024 Artisan AI Inc.

Once she understands your needs, she creates an outbound campaign, selects potential leads from her database of over 270 million contacts, and starts prospecting.

This well-known sales software has been a powerhouse for over two decades.\n\n  \n\nWhile it's not cheap and requires significant setup, it's incredibly powerful for mid-sized and large sales teams. Salesforce’s all-in-one CRM solution, Sales Cloud, is highly customizable to meet any business needs and includes various sales automation tools. \n\n  \n\nMind that Salesforce’s flexibility comes with high setup costs and a steep learning curve. It’s not another out-of-the-box solution you can log into and start prospecting. While Salesforce _can_ handle outbound sales, that's not its main draw. Businesses choose Salesforce for its ability to automate complex sales cycles, where its complexity really pays off.\n\n  \n\nSalesforce also offers Einstein Copilot, an AI assistant designed to tackle repetitive tasks.

It’s a sales automation and pipeline management tool with the capability to build outbound workflows. \n\n  \n\nIn Pipedrive, sales teams can handle leads and deals from beginning to end. However, contrary to Salesforce, it’s also more intuitive and out-of-the-box _(and, therefore, less flexible)._\n\n  \n\nFor SDRs, the platform provides convenient task reminders, triggered messages, automated follow-ups, and an AI sales assistant.

With it, you can reach out to prospects using basic automated email campaigns.\n\n  \n\n### Key features \n\n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Prospecting filters** range from tracking recent job changes to analyzing companies’ tech stacks and predicting conversion likelihood.\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Contact enrichment** adds detailed contact information directly into your CRM or sales tools.\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Email engagement tools** automate outreach with targeted email sequences.\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Lusha Extension’s contact finder** lets you find contact details directly from LinkedIn profiles and other websites.\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Prospecting API** allows you to easily update and enrich large amounts of lead data in your CRM.\n    \n      \n    \n\n### Why choose Lusha\n\n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    Fully eliminates the need to search for leads manually.\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    Claims compliance with the world's highest international privacy standards.\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    SDRs mainly favor Lusha for its browser extension, simplifying contact extraction from LinkedIn profiles.\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    User-friendly setup and operation, suitable for all experience levels.\n    \n      \n    \n\n### Lusha’s limitations\n\n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    Unlike Artisan and Growbots, Lusha lacks email deliverability tools. \n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    It isn't powered by AI, which also means it doesn’t assist you with email outreach or optimize its prospecting workflows automatically.\n    \n      \n    \n\n8\\.

You can use advanced search filters for criteria such as recent job changes, seniority level, and companies with job openings, in addition to standard filters like job title and industry. \n\n  \n\nOnce you've identified potential leads, you can create prospect lists, set up alerts to track their activity or start outreach campaigns immediately.\n\n  \n![linkedin](https://www.artisan.co/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.ctfassets.net%2Fkyprwggh4muz%2FM2N1S91UZnL0RsFDF0EYM%2F75c2dfa9164ab5ef9e4800ea8d1e3a65%2Flinkedin.webp&w=3840&q=75)\n\n### Key features\n\n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Advanced LinkedIn search filters** allow SDRs to find the right leads quickly.\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Alerts and real-time updates** help to keep track of changes in lead data.\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Buyer Intent** signals when leads interact with the business’s LinkedIn company page or company website.\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **InMail messaging** enables direct communication with prospects outside your network.\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **CRM integration** ensures seamless syncing of lead data with your existing sales tools.\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **TeamLink** analyzes your entire team’s network to identify hidden paths to make warm introductions.\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Saved Searches** enable you to save your search criteria and receive updates when new leads match your filters.\n    \n      \n    \n\n### Why choose LinkedIn Sales Navigator\n\n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    Access to LinkedIn’s extensive professional network.\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    No need to navigate third-party interfaces to find and connect with your LinkedIn leads.\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    A relatively affordable solution compared to many outbound automation tools.\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    Advanced filters, saved searches, and alerts present more opportunities to source qualified leads than with a basic LinkedIn account.\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    Easy integration with most tools in your tech stack.\n    \n      \n    \n\n### LinkedIn Sales Navigator’s limitations\n\n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    Full CRM integration is only available with the Advanced Plus plan _(an enterprise-level package)._\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    The monthly limit of 50 InMail messages across all plans is rather restrictive.\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    You have to perform all the processes manually.\n    \n      \n    \n\n3\\.

This well-known sales software has been a powerhouse for over two decades.\n\n  \n\nWhile it's not cheap and requires significant setup, it's incredibly powerful for mid-sized and large sales teams. Salesforce’s all-in-one CRM solution, Sales Cloud, is highly customizable to meet any business needs and includes various sales automation tools. \n\n  \n\nMind that Salesforce’s flexibility comes with high setup costs and a steep learning curve. It’s not another out-of-the-box solution you can log into and start prospecting. While Salesforce _can_ handle outbound sales, that's not its main draw. Businesses choose Salesforce for its ability to automate complex sales cycles, where its complexity really pays off.\n\n  \n\nSalesforce also offers Einstein Copilot, an AI assistant designed to tackle repetitive tasks. It can generate emails, answer questions about your performance, help you prioritize leads, update your pipeline, and more.\n\n  \n![Intergration salesforce](https://www.artisan.co/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.ctfassets.net%2Fkyprwggh4muz%2F4MHFpwQsHnj6VaRIMTrZ7M%2Fe80fdb27f4ec78581eb42b1679451d3b%2FIntergration_salesforce.webp&w=3840&q=75)\n\n### Key features\n\n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **A highly customizable CRM system** grows with your sales team.\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **A comprehensive sales automation tech stack** empowers salespeople through every process, from outbound lead generation to revenue analytics. \n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Integration capabilities** with various business applications allow you to seamlessly sync Salesforce data with other business tools and systems.\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Einstein Copilot AI assistant** enables task automation and provides quick insights.\n    \n      \n    \n\n### Why choose Salesforce\n\n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    An advanced platform that has everything you need _(given that you build it by yourself)._\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    Salesforce can be heavily adjusted to meet your business needs and processes.\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    It can become your central business data hub, collecting and processing information from various sources.\n    \n      \n    \n\n### Salesforce’s limitations\n\n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    Pricing builds up really quickly as many features are available as add-ons, including the AI copilot.\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    Software is complex, leading to a more extensive setup and onboarding process in comparison to simpler sales software.\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    Salesforce doesn't provide you with B2B leads data.

It’s a sales automation and pipeline management tool with the capability to build outbound workflows. \n\n  \n\nIn Pipedrive, sales teams can handle leads and deals from beginning to end. However, contrary to Salesforce, it’s also more intuitive and out-of-the-box _(and, therefore, less flexible)._\n\n  \n\nFor SDRs, the platform provides convenient task reminders, triggered messages, automated follow-ups, and an AI sales assistant. Pipedrive's AI enhances outbound workflows with actions like recommending high-potential deals and suggesting priority actions to streamline sales processes.\n\n  \n\n### Key features\n\n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Email outreach tools** simplify the creation and sending of bulk emails, along with setting up automated email sequences.\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **The meeting scheduler** integrates with your calendar, allowing hot leads to book calls with sales agents instantly. \n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Lead management** helps to qualify, track, and prioritize potential customers semi-automatically.\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Customizable pipelines** allow you to implement your ideal sales process by creating custom lead paths and goals.\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Team collaboration** supports smooth communication and teamwork among sales reps.\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Detailed performance reports** offer insights into your leads-to-deals conversion rates, deal velocity, team effectiveness, revenue forecasts, and other critical data.  \n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **AI-powered sales assistant** augments all of the features above. \n    \n      \n    \n\n### Why choose Pipedrive\n\n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    Ideal for managing your entire sales process, from prospecting to closing deals.\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    Among the most affordable software options available.\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    Perfect for beginners and small businesses looking to streamline sales operations.\n    \n      \n    \n\n### Pipedrive’s limitations\n\n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    Pipedrive doesn’t fully automate outbound prospecting.

The platform records phone calls, transcribes them, extracts AI insights, and syncs the data to your CRM.\n\n  \n\n### Key features\n\n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Contact and account search** helps you find ideal leads and companies quickly.\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Intent signals** like website engagement, headcount growth, and other custom criteria are monitored to spot when prospects show interest and are ready to engage.\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Click-to-call dialing** lets you make cold calls directly within the platform.\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Meeting scheduler** syncs with your calendar for easy appointment booking.\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Chrome extension** provides quick access to Apollo’s features from LinkedIn, your CRM system, or other cloud software.\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Sales performance overview** uncovers insights into your team’s activity, outreach efforts, messaging effectiveness, etc.\n    \n      \n    \n\n### Why choose Apollo\n\n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    Lets you connect with prospects both through email outreach and cold calls. \n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    Centralizes outbound and inbound sales strategies within a single platform.\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    Uses AI for personalized prospect recommendations, data analysis, and email writing.\n    \n      \n    \n\n### Apollo’s limitations\n\n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    Apollo’s email engagement suite doesn’t include a warmup feature.\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    The wide array of tools may feel confusing, especially if you don’t need all of them.\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    Help content isn’t comprehensive enough to smoothly navigate Apollo’s functionality.\n    \n      \n    \n\n9\\.

And for good reason. AI is a sea of change for automating and optimizing our sales prospecting efforts. \n\n  \n\nBut how does AI impact sales prospecting in clear and practical ways? It's all about creative and tech-savvy people leveraging solutions to make their jobs that much easier.\n\n  \n\nHere, we’re covering the how, the who, and the where of AI in sales prospecting, including our five favorite platforms in 2024. \n\n  \n\nUnderstanding AI in Sales Prospecting\n-------------------------------------\n\nSales prospecting is the bread and butter of most sales functions. But modern sales software has a way of radically shifting how we think of traditional practices. \n\n  \n\n### What is sales prospecting, and how is it important?\n\nSales prospecting identifies and engages customers (prospects) who could find value in your brand or products. At the heart of this process is the sales pipeline through which you can nurture leads from first contact to final sale. \n\n  \n\nThe steps in this pipeline include:\n\n  \n\n1.  ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Identifying possible leads** based on your ideal customer profile and research.\n    \n      \n    \n2.  ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Qualifying these leads** to determine if they fit your profiles.\n    \n      \n    \n3.  ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Engaging leads through ongoing marketing efforts**, such as emails, social media outreach, or other approaches. This step could include cool or informative assets like demos, direct meetings, or easily accessible marketing materials.\n    \n      \n    \n4.  ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Nurturing leads** through the pipeline by building relationships through strategic engagement at touch points.\n    \n      \n    \n5.  ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Converting those leads into sales**.\n    \n      \n    \n\n  \n\nThe idea of a sales pipeline is essential because it gives you a representation of your sales flow–a critical blueprint to guide strategy, optimization, and forecasting. This helps you create and optimize marketing strategies that speak to those customers. \n\n  \n\n### How is AI enhancing sales prospecting?\n\n[According to McKinsey](https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/quantumblack/our-insights/the-state-of-ai)\n, two primary areas where AI has been implemented are product development and marketing/sales. In the latter's case, adoption has more than doubled in the past year. \n\n  \n![Sales Prospecting 2](https://www.artisan.co/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.ctfassets.net%2Fkyprwggh4muz%2F4L8q2xoe6ZKdGHPnYGU6WD%2F9abd8d274d1295121b550a0fdc14959d%2FSales_Prospecting_2.webp&w=3840&q=75)\n\nThis is where AI revolutionizes prospecting–drawing from the automated and data-driven capabilities of AI to boost core prospecting efforts. Modern salespeople are looking to AI to enhance processes like:\n\n  \n\n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Qualifying leads quickly and accurately.** AI eliminates manual labor in qualifying leads, saving time and improving consistency. Automating the process means that qualification standards are applied consistently across potential candidates, and the best leads rise to the top.\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Streamlining outreach without sacrificing quality.** AI can take outreach one step further by applying intelligence to engage customers based on complex behaviors.\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Delivering real personalization shaped with data.** Marketers are quickly learning how AI can help them personalize sales outreach with tailored messaging and human-like chatbots.\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Using data to drive decisions.** As salespeople, we love our data, but we can’t truly digest all of it on our own. That’s why [73% of professionals](https://blog.hubspot.com/sales/state-of-ai-sales#:~:text=Yet%2C%20when%20we%20look%20at,what%20they%20do%20best:%20selling.)\n     see AI helping them pull more insights from their data than they could alone. AI does this while providing a ready source of actionable suggestions based on customer behavioral insights.\n    \n      \n    \n\n  \n\nThese enhancements have real-world impacts. [According to a Deloitte report](https://www2.deloitte.com/us/en/pages/about-deloitte/articles/yes-you-can-take-the-guesswork-out-of-lead-gen.html)\n, a cloud services company adopting AI into its sales prospect pipeline experienced a 20% increase in pipeline volume. \n\n  \n\n### What are the benefits of AI in sales prospecting?\n\nWith AI, sales teams can improve their processes internally (regarding logistics and productivity) and externally (outreach and messaging).\n\n  \n![Sales Prospecting 4](https://www.artisan.co/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.ctfassets.net%2Fkyprwggh4muz%2Fgxv4bSXg82nP2tk50uocT%2F01e81439e658c85952aaff986bcd2996%2FSales_Prospecting_4.webp&w=3840&q=75)\n\nWith AI, you can:\n\n  \n\n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    Cut costs in terms of time, money, and resources. \n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    Boost productivity so salespeople can do more with the same resources.\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    Draw from actual data to brainstorm creative assets like emails, social media posts, and engagement campaigns.\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    Tailor messaging to discrete audiences effectively.\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    Improve your ability to map email sequences for outreach and follow-up.\n    \n      \n    \n\n  \n\n**Ready to experience the power of AI-driven outbound?** [Hire our AI BDR Ava](https://www.artisan.co/ai-sales-agent)\n and she'll launch a campaign for you within minutes!\n\n  \n\n### The essential AI technologies driving sales prospecting\n\nMarketing and sales platforms that leverage AI are most likely incorporating one or more of these intelligent automation technologies to revamp or streamline one or more processes completely: \n\n  \n\n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    If AI is intelligence, **machine learning is the learning foundation on which it is built**. These algorithms rely on historical data and models (language or analytical models) to provide deep insights into particular trends or data sets.\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    One area where machine learning contributes is **predictive analytics**, or the use of intelligent algorithms to predict future trends in data. For example, an AI providing predictive analytics can offer hypothetical scores to leads based on existing data to inform where and how marketing pros identify leads. \n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Gen AI represents a massive step forward in intelligent systems**, and professionals are noticing… [which is why 65% of respondents to a McKinsey survey noted their use of the technology](https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/quantumblack/our-insights/the-state-of-ai)\n    . Gen AI is perfect for language learning and communication, content generation, and supporting conversational customer interactions.\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Modern chatbots** can have fully realized conversations with potential customers and react in real time, providing information or insight that guides the customer from an initial contact towards a more meaningful engagement.\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    Modern sales and marketing rely on immediacy. **Real-time insights** combine AI's speed and creativity to deliver a better customer experience to the prospect. \n    \n      \n    \n\nHow to Implement AI in Sales Prospecting\n----------------------------------------\n\nThe notion of “implementing AI” into a process like prospecting might seem daunting for non-specialists. And yet, [68% of sales professionals](https://blog.hubspot.com/sales/state-of-ai-sales)\n predict that most software will already have AI baked in–signaling that maybe sales professionals don’t have to worry too much about accessing the technology because it is already here.  \n\n  \n\nThat leaves you with the need to plan, adopt, and optimize your use of AI. \n\n  \n\n### Steps to integrate AI tools into your sales process\n\nWhile AI is an exciting tool, it is, after all, just a tool. You must know your ideal customer profile and how AI can help you prospect them. \n\n  \n![Sales Prospecting 13](https://www.artisan.co/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.ctfassets.net%2Fkyprwggh4muz%2F5uc3DynIcKvRaieRZcGac5%2F1bb6c5b6b93cf47813adae42ea4a69c1%2FSales_Prospecting_13.webp&w=3840&q=75)\n\nThen, it’s all about finding the right tool for the right job. So, do you need:\n\n  \n\n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Specific or Comprehensive Tools?** Is it a niche feature that will bring those prospects in, or something more end-to-end (like [Artisan](https://www.artisan.co/)\n    ) where AI is baked into the entire prospecting pipeline? \n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Broad or Focused Capabilities?** If you’re looking for automated email outreach, you might not need an entire suite of automated tools better served for an omni-channel approach. For example, while Artisan provides AI support across the outbound cycle, another platform like Reply.io focuses on automating outreach. \n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Extensive Integrations?** If you’re firmly rooted in a productivity or CRM environment, then it’s imperative for any solution to fit within your workflow. Most businesses fit within this model, but having an entire library of integrations might not be that important for others. \n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Expert Support and Usability?** How familiar is your team with AI tools? If you want to adapt quickly, you will look for extensive usability, training, and educational resources.\n    \n      \n    \n\nBest Practices for Using AI in Sales\n------------------------------------\n\nAI works primarily as a tool, but real expertise is required to make the most of it. That’s where marketers' skills and knowledge can apply best practices and create something truly engaging for their prospects. \n\n  \n\n### Focus on personalization\n\nWriting personalized emails takes time and energy that could be better spent on strategies or direct engagements with prospects. AI can streamline the process by building emails from pre-existing templates or approaches. \n\n  \n![Sales Prospecting 14](https://www.artisan.co/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.ctfassets.net%2Fkyprwggh4muz%2F5fhzev8ttUQ7V2FFGok5fI%2F0eaaf06fbe543ae915bb3ad96d516edd%2FSales_Prospecting_14.webp&w=3840&q=75)\n\nArtisan’s email writing features include proprietary playbooks that address personal connections like shared university backgrounds or offer thought-provoking and relevant industry questions that prompt conversations with prospects. \n\n  \n\n**Leverage proprietary AI-crafted emails to make your prospecting content powerful and personal in a way that gets responses.** [Try Ava Now](https://www.artisan.co/ai-sales-agent)\n.\n\n  \n\n### Make sure to follow up\n\nWhen, where, and how to follow up with prospects requires data entry, planning, and scheduling hours. But, with AI tools (especially all-in-one solutions), you can automate outreach and follow-ups based on contexts, time-based criteria, or prospect behavior. In Artisan, you can automate three-step email sequences that will stop once that prospect responds. \n\n  \n\nAutomated outreach allows you to focus on being thoughtful and creative rather than managing spreadsheets and calendars–a reality that, [according to Salesforce](https://www.salesforce.com/news/stories/generative-ai-statistics/#h-marketers-believe-generative-ai-will-transform-their-role-but-worry-about-accuracy)\n, seven out of ten markets expect to become a reality. \n\n  \n\n### Optimize, optimize, optimize\n\nAbove and beyond all, you should use AI to optimize all outbound materials to capitalize on what works and weed out approaches that down. From calls to emails and social media engagement, AI can help you deliver better information and value to prospects based on real insights. \n\n  \n\n### Always rely on data\n\nPersonalization, follow-up, optimization… These best practices work because you can use data to tailor each to real insights rather than gut feelings or trends. With Artisan’s database of 300M+ B2B contacts, you’re never relying on anything but the best data to inform your decision-making. \n\n  \n\nTop 5 AI Tools for Sales Prospecting in 2024\n--------------------------------------------\n\n### 1\\.

And for good reason. AI is a sea of change for automating and optimizing our sales prospecting efforts. \n\n  \n\nBut how does AI impact sales prospecting in clear and practical ways? It's all about creative and tech-savvy people leveraging solutions to make their jobs that much easier.\n\n  \n\nHere, we’re covering the how, the who, and the where of AI in sales prospecting, including our five favorite platforms in 2024. \n\n  \n\nUnderstanding AI in Sales Prospecting\n-------------------------------------\n\nSales prospecting is the bread and butter of most sales functions. But modern sales software has a way of radically shifting how we think of traditional practices. \n\n  \n\n### What is sales prospecting, and how is it important?\n\nSales prospecting identifies and engages customers (prospects) who could find value in your brand or products. At the heart of this process is the sales pipeline through which you can nurture leads from first contact to final sale. \n\n  \n\nThe steps in this pipeline include:\n\n  \n\n1.  ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Identifying possible leads** based on your ideal customer profile and research.\n    \n      \n    \n2.  ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Qualifying these leads** to determine if they fit your profiles.\n    \n      \n    \n3.  ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Engaging leads through ongoing marketing efforts**, such as emails, social media outreach, or other approaches. This step could include cool or informative assets like demos, direct meetings, or easily accessible marketing materials.\n    \n      \n    \n4.  ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Nurturing leads** through the pipeline by building relationships through strategic engagement at touch points.\n    \n      \n    \n5.  ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Converting those leads into sales**.\n    \n      \n    \n\n  \n\nThe idea of a sales pipeline is essential because it gives you a representation of your sales flow–a critical blueprint to guide strategy, optimization, and forecasting. This helps you create and optimize marketing strategies that speak to those customers. \n\n  \n\n### How is AI enhancing sales prospecting?\n\n[According to McKinsey](https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/quantumblack/our-insights/the-state-of-ai)\n, two primary areas where AI has been implemented are product development and marketing/sales. In the latter's case, adoption has more than doubled in the past year. \n\n  \n![Sales Prospecting 2](https://www.artisan.co/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.ctfassets.net%2Fkyprwggh4muz%2F4L8q2xoe6ZKdGHPnYGU6WD%2F9abd8d274d1295121b550a0fdc14959d%2FSales_Prospecting_2.webp&w=3840&q=75)\n\nThis is where AI revolutionizes prospecting–drawing from the automated and data-driven capabilities of AI to boost core prospecting efforts. Modern salespeople are looking to AI to enhance processes like:\n\n  \n\n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Qualifying leads quickly and accurately.** AI eliminates manual labor in qualifying leads, saving time and improving consistency. Automating the process means that qualification standards are applied consistently across potential candidates, and the best leads rise to the top.\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Streamlining outreach without sacrificing quality.** AI can take outreach one step further by applying intelligence to engage customers based on complex behaviors.\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Delivering real personalization shaped with data.** Marketers are quickly learning how AI can help them personalize sales outreach with tailored messaging and human-like chatbots.\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Using data to drive decisions.** As salespeople, we love our data, but we can’t truly digest all of it on our own. That’s why [73% of professionals](https://blog.hubspot.com/sales/state-of-ai-sales#:~:text=Yet%2C%20when%20we%20look%20at,what%20they%20do%20best:%20selling.)\n     see AI helping them pull more insights from their data than they could alone. AI does this while providing a ready source of actionable suggestions based on customer behavioral insights.\n    \n      \n    \n\n  \n\nThese enhancements have real-world impacts. [According to a Deloitte report](https://www2.deloitte.com/us/en/pages/about-deloitte/articles/yes-you-can-take-the-guesswork-out-of-lead-gen.html)\n, a cloud services company adopting AI into its sales prospect pipeline experienced a 20% increase in pipeline volume. \n\n  \n\n### What are the benefits of AI in sales prospecting?\n\nWith AI, sales teams can improve their processes internally (regarding logistics and productivity) and externally (outreach and messaging).\n\n  \n![Sales Prospecting 4](https://www.artisan.co/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.ctfassets.net%2Fkyprwggh4muz%2Fgxv4bSXg82nP2tk50uocT%2F01e81439e658c85952aaff986bcd2996%2FSales_Prospecting_4.webp&w=3840&q=75)\n\nWith AI, you can:\n\n  \n\n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    Cut costs in terms of time, money, and resources. \n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    Boost productivity so salespeople can do more with the same resources.\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    Draw from actual data to brainstorm creative assets like emails, social media posts, and engagement campaigns.\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    Tailor messaging to discrete audiences effectively.\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    Improve your ability to map email sequences for outreach and follow-up.\n    \n      \n    \n\n  \n\n**Ready to experience the power of AI-driven outbound?** [Hire our AI BDR Ava](https://www.artisan.co/ai-sales-agent)\n and she'll launch a campaign for you within minutes!\n\n  \n\n### The essential AI technologies driving sales prospecting\n\nMarketing and sales platforms that leverage AI are most likely incorporating one or more of these intelligent automation technologies to revamp or streamline one or more processes completely: \n\n  \n\n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    If AI is intelligence, **machine learning is the learning foundation on which it is built**. These algorithms rely on historical data and models (language or analytical models) to provide deep insights into particular trends or data sets.\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    One area where machine learning contributes is **predictive analytics**, or the use of intelligent algorithms to predict future trends in data. For example, an AI providing predictive analytics can offer hypothetical scores to leads based on existing data to inform where and how marketing pros identify leads. \n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Gen AI represents a massive step forward in intelligent systems**, and professionals are noticing… [which is why 65% of respondents to a McKinsey survey noted their use of the technology](https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/quantumblack/our-insights/the-state-of-ai)\n    . Gen AI is perfect for language learning and communication, content generation, and supporting conversational customer interactions.\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Modern chatbots** can have fully realized conversations with potential customers and react in real time, providing information or insight that guides the customer from an initial contact towards a more meaningful engagement.\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    Modern sales and marketing rely on immediacy. **Real-time insights** combine AI's speed and creativity to deliver a better customer experience to the prospect. \n    \n      \n    \n\nHow to Implement AI in Sales Prospecting\n----------------------------------------\n\nThe notion of “implementing AI” into a process like prospecting might seem daunting for non-specialists. And yet, [68% of sales professionals](https://blog.hubspot.com/sales/state-of-ai-sales)\n predict that most software will already have AI baked in–signaling that maybe sales professionals don’t have to worry too much about accessing the technology because it is already here.  \n\n  \n\nThat leaves you with the need to plan, adopt, and optimize your use of AI. \n\n  \n\n### Steps to integrate AI tools into your sales process\n\nWhile AI is an exciting tool, it is, after all, just a tool. You must know your ideal customer profile and how AI can help you prospect them. \n\n  \n![Sales Prospecting 13](https://www.artisan.co/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.ctfassets.net%2Fkyprwggh4muz%2F5uc3DynIcKvRaieRZcGac5%2F1bb6c5b6b93cf47813adae42ea4a69c1%2FSales_Prospecting_13.webp&w=3840&q=75)\n\nThen, it’s all about finding the right tool for the right job. So, do you need:\n\n  \n\n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Specific or Comprehensive Tools?** Is it a niche feature that will bring those prospects in, or something more end-to-end (like [Artisan](https://www.artisan.co/)\n    ) where AI is baked into the entire prospecting pipeline? \n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Broad or Focused Capabilities?** If you’re looking for automated email outreach, you might not need an entire suite of automated tools better served for an omni-channel approach. For example, while Artisan provides AI support across the outbound cycle, another platform like Reply.io focuses on automating outreach. \n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Extensive Integrations?** If you’re firmly rooted in a productivity or CRM environment, then it’s imperative for any solution to fit within your workflow. Most businesses fit within this model, but having an entire library of integrations might not be that important for others. \n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Expert Support and Usability?** How familiar is your team with AI tools? If you want to adapt quickly, you will look for extensive usability, training, and educational resources.\n    \n      \n    \n\nBest Practices for Using AI in Sales\n------------------------------------\n\nAI works primarily as a tool, but real expertise is required to make the most of it. That’s where marketers' skills and knowledge can apply best practices and create something truly engaging for their prospects. \n\n  \n\n### Focus on personalization\n\nWriting personalized emails takes time and energy that could be better spent on strategies or direct engagements with prospects. AI can streamline the process by building emails from pre-existing templates or approaches. \n\n  \n![Sales Prospecting 14](https://www.artisan.co/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.ctfassets.net%2Fkyprwggh4muz%2F5fhzev8ttUQ7V2FFGok5fI%2F0eaaf06fbe543ae915bb3ad96d516edd%2FSales_Prospecting_14.webp&w=3840&q=75)\n\nArtisan’s email writing features include proprietary playbooks that address personal connections like shared university backgrounds or offer thought-provoking and relevant industry questions that prompt conversations with prospects. \n\n  \n\n**Leverage proprietary AI-crafted emails to make your prospecting content powerful and personal in a way that gets responses.** [Try Ava Now](https://www.artisan.co/ai-sales-agent)\n.\n\n  \n\n### Make sure to follow up\n\nWhen, where, and how to follow up with prospects requires data entry, planning, and scheduling hours. But, with AI tools (especially all-in-one solutions), you can automate outreach and follow-ups based on contexts, time-based criteria, or prospect behavior. In Artisan, you can automate three-step email sequences that will stop once that prospect responds. \n\n  \n\nAutomated outreach allows you to focus on being thoughtful and creative rather than managing spreadsheets and calendars–a reality that, [according to Salesforce](https://www.salesforce.com/news/stories/generative-ai-statistics/#h-marketers-believe-generative-ai-will-transform-their-role-but-worry-about-accuracy)\n, seven out of ten markets expect to become a reality. \n\n  \n\n### Optimize, optimize, optimize\n\nAbove and beyond all, you should use AI to optimize all outbound materials to capitalize on what works and weed out approaches that down. From calls to emails and social media engagement, AI can help you deliver better information and value to prospects based on real insights. \n\n  \n\n### Always rely on data\n\nPersonalization, follow-up, optimization… These best practices work because you can use data to tailor each to real insights rather than gut feelings or trends. With Artisan’s database of 300M+ B2B contacts, you’re never relying on anything but the best data to inform your decision-making. \n\n  \n\nTop 5 AI Tools for Sales Prospecting in 2024\n--------------------------------------------\n\n### 1\\.

For example, Artisan integrates with HubSpot and Salesforce and provides engineering services to support other integrations that our customers need. \n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Training and Culture.** [39% of marketers don’t know how to use GenAI safely, and 43% claim they don’t know how to get the most value from it](https://www.salesforce.com/news/stories/generative-ai-statistics/#h-marketers-believe-generative-ai-will-transform-their-role-but-worry-about-accuracy)\n    . That’s why support and educational services (like those offered by Artisan) are critical to ensuring a smooth transition and adoption phase.\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Privacy.** Whether you work in healthcare, financial services, or government-adjacent business, your solution must meet industry-specific standards and policies related to security and privacy (such as perimeter security, data obfuscation, or access controls). \n    \n      \n    \n\nFuture Trends in AI Sales Prospecting\n-------------------------------------\n\nSales prospecting is rapidly evolving, and in many ways, it’s impossible to tell where the technology will go. However, there are two directions in which we see innovation taking off:\n\n  \n\n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **AI Automation.** Sophisticated AI systems will open up automation in an increasing pool of tasks and processes, including more sophisticated insights, integrations, and customer experiences. At some point, it’s unlikely that humans will handle manual tasks related to their pipeline again. \n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **AI Employees.** Artisan sees the future of AI prospecting as including AI-powered Sales and Business Development Representatives who can work side-by-side with human professionals to make outreach even quicker and more effective. \n    \n      \n    \n\n  \n\n**Supercharge your sales with** [Ava, our AI BDR](https://www.artisan.co/ai-sales-agent)\n**.** Experience next-level outreach and see your pipeline soar.\n\n  \n\n  \n\nShare Article\n\n![copy-link](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/copy-link.svg)[![copy-link](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/mail.svg)](mailto:?body=https://www.artisan.co/blog/ai-for-sales-prospecting)\n\nYou might also like\n-------------------\n\nReady to Supercharge Your Outbound?\n-----------------------------------\n\nOur AI-first platform equips your team with best-in-class outbound tools and our AI BDR Ava, who automates your entire outbound workflow.\n\nPhone\n\nGet Started\n\n### Products\n\n*   [Artisan Sales Overview](/sales-ai)\n    \n*   [Ava, the AI Sales Agent](/ai-sales-agent)\n    \n*   [B2B Data](/products/b2b-data)\n    \n*   [Sales Playbooks](/products/sales-playbooks)\n    \n*   [Email Warmup](/products/email-warmup)\n    \n*   [Sales Automation](/products/sales-automation)\n    \n\n### Resources\n\n*   [Blog](/blog)\n    \n*   [Demos](/watch-demo)\n    \n*   [Support](https://support.artisan.co/)\n    \n*   [Case Studies](/casestudies)\n    \n*   ChangelogSoon\n    \n\n### Solutions\n\n*   [Enterprise](/solutions/enterprise)\n    \n*   [Midmarket](/solutions/midmarket)\n    \n*   [Startups](/solutions/startups)\n    \n*   Lead Gen AgenciesSoon\n    \n\n### Company\n\n*   [About Us](/about)\n    \n*   [Contact Us](/contact-us)\n    \n*   [Careers](/careers)\n    \n*   Artisan LabsSoon\n    \n\n![artisan-logo](https://www.artisan.co/_next/image?url=%2Fassets%2Flogo.webp&w=384&q=75)\n\n© 2024 Artisan AI Inc.

However, times have changed, and so has the essence of cold emails.\n\n  \n\nToday’s cold emailing landscape is all about relationship building, where the focus is centered on nurturing genuine connections, addressing recipients’ needs, and opening the door to mutually beneficial partnerships.\n\n  \n\n_It’s all about_ **_value_**_._\n\n  \n\nSo, we’ve set the scene, and class is now in session. This is the complete and comprehensive guide to cold emailing. After this, you’ll never send an email in the same way again.\n\n  \n\nWith a fresh perspective, cold emailing can evolve into a powerful tool in your business arsenal capable of influencing prospects and creating lasting impressions.\n\n  \n\nLet’s get into it.\n\n  \n\nWhat is Cold Emailing?\n----------------------\n\n![31](https://www.artisan.co/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.ctfassets.net%2Fkyprwggh4muz%2Fj7tMTrxRbEtnxaIOpDeFf%2F6e339f5b70dbff848a3d07c2283b78c3%2F31.png&w=3840&q=75)\n\nCold emailing is a strategy where you send an outreach message to a contact with whom you’ve had no prior interaction.\n\n  \n\nDespite many likening cold emailing to unsolicited spam, in 2023, the dynamics of cold emailing have taken a turn, further highlighting its effectiveness when used correctly.\n\n  \n\n_Emphasis on the “_**_correctly_**_.”_\n\n  \n\nLet’s look at the stats.\n\n  \n\n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    [43% of salespeople](https://blog.hubspot.com/sales/hubspot-sales-strategy-report?hubs_content=blog.hubspot.com%2Fsales%2Fsubject-line-stats-open-rates-slideshare&hubs_content-cta=HubSpot%E2%80%99s%202023%20Sales%20Trends%20Report&__hstc=210964170.570d08a167d0d5dd052b867f69b2113a.1698136652776.1698136652776.1698136652776.1&__hssc=210964170.1.1698136652776&__hsfp=780687628)\n     state that email is the most effective sales channel\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    80% of buyers prefer email contact, with [71% open to receiving emails](https://www.rainsalestraining.com/blog/b2b-sales-funnel-stages)\n     when they’re looking to improve their business results\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    [62% of prospects](https://www.rainsalestraining.com/blog/b2b-sales-funnel-stages)\n     open emails when they’re looking for solutions\n    \n      \n    \n\n  \nYet, the facts show that sales teams are still not providing the experience people want with their emails, and understanding this makes it crystal clear why so many people cry that their emails don’t work.\n\n  \n\nFor example, 81% of all emails are opened on a mobile device, yet only [20% of email campaigns](https://www.superoffice.com/blog/b2b-email-marketing-report/)\n are optimized for said devices.\n\n  \n\nOkay, so what’s going on?\n\n  \n\nEmail is the most effective channel, [boasting a 420% ROI,](https://www.luisazhou.com/blog/email-marketing-roi-statistics/)\n yet open rates are low despite people actively opening emails when they’re in the market for a purchase. Still, marketers are creating email campaigns that don’t work.\n\n  \n\nIt’s pretty clear that there’s a lapse in knowledge and understanding between marketers, salespeople, and their customers. A lot of marketers continue to use tactics that simply do not work.\n\n  \n![32](https://www.artisan.co/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.ctfassets.net%2Fkyprwggh4muz%2FLsYOrjeyZYBZ14DI4h0Di%2F834f5c5d8f664911c03b5b95fd64d29e%2F32.png&w=3840&q=75)\n\nPut it this way: have you tried to spruce up your email subject lines by putting emojis in them?\n\n  \n\nLots of people have, yet emails have a [1.84% higher open rate](https://www.getresponse.com/resources/reports/email-marketing-benchmarks)\n WITHOUT emojis. Alternatively, personalized a subject line with the prospect’s name boosts [it to 43%](https://blog.klenty.com/cold-email-statistics/)\n.\n\n  \n\nWhen it comes to you and your sales efforts, be proactive about knowing the industry, its trends, and what potential customers, prospects, and clients actually want. Then, tailor your efforts towards that.\n\n  \n\nAnd no, it’s not spam or simply sending out as many emails as possible and playing a numbers game. It’s a targeted strategy used exclusively for qualified leads intended to add value and relevance to the recipient’s inbox.\n\n  \n\nLet’s break it down:\n\n  \n\n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Proactive, Not Indiscriminate**: Cold emails are sent explicitly to qualified leads, aligning with their interests and needs.

[Artisan AI Sales Reps](/ai-sales-agent)\n, for example, come with 265 million built-in contacts and automate processes like ghostwriting emails and responding to prospects’ questions.\n\n  \n\nCold emails have moved on from their traditional methods and now lend themselves as instrumental tools not just for sales but for business growth, networking, recruiting, public relations, and market research.\n\n  \n\nThis evolution and range of uses have reimagined cold emails positively, making them a popular choice among marketers and business professionals worldwide.\n\n  \n\nCold Emailing: It’s More than Just Sales\n----------------------------------------\n\n![33](https://www.artisan.co/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.ctfassets.net%2Fkyprwggh4muz%2Fsq6mVlEXTTgPr8SCztEJR%2Fc632c8df55511c0b0b4ea9b6d53313fe%2F33.png&w=3840&q=75)\n\nLet’s face it: we’ve all been on the receiving end of some frosty cold emails.\n\n  \n\nIf you’re grappling with the idea of how to engage your audience without coming off as intrusive, here’s the good news – it’s entirely possible!

Remember, numbers don’t lie!\n    \n      \n    \n\n  \nThese need to apply to everything you do.\n\n  \n\nOh, and remember, cold emailing is more than just a sales instrument. These days, it serves as an ingenious medium to achieve various business objectives. If “diversify” is your motto, cold emailing can be your Swiss army knife.\n\n  \n\nHere’s a glimpse into the versatile use cases for cold emailing:\n\n  \n\n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Networking**: Cold emails help you reach out to industry influencers, thought leaders, or even potential mentors who might otherwise be out of reach.\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Partnerships and Collaborations**: Joint ventures?

This crucial line influences whether a recipient opens your email, dismisses it, or worse, reports it as spam – a decision your prospects will be making in a split-second! Make your impact count.\n\n  \n\nThe ‘From’ line is actually the perfect tool to build trust, establish credibility, and kickstart your relationship with the recipient. The key is to be clear, honest, and leave no room for misunderstanding about who the email is from.\n\n  \n\n### **Personalizing the ‘From’ Line: Best Cold Emailing Practices**\n\nWhen it comes to writing your ‘From’ line, personalization should be your guiding star.\n\n  \n\nHere are a couple of strategies to help you personalize like a pro:\n\n  \n\n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Use your name**: People prefer conversations with other people, not faceless brands. Including your name makes the email feel more personal and trustworthy.\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Use a great profile photo:** A professional headshot that clearly shows your face is a great way to project authority and credibility. Try an [AI headshot generator](https://www.dreamwave.ai/ai-headshots)\n     for one-click professional headshots or [company headshots](https://www.dreamwave.ai/company-headshots)\n    . Or, if you’d like more creative control, an [AI photo generator](https://www.dreamwave.ai/ai-photo-generator)\n     is a great way to prompt specific outfits and backgrounds for your [professional headshots](https://www.dreamwave.ai/ai-headshots)\n    .\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Add your company**: To boost credibility, pair your name with your company’s, like “John from XYZCo.” It’s professional, transparent, and leaves no doubt about your affiliation.\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Avoid no-reply**: Using “no-reply” in your ‘From’ line is the equivalent of saying, “Don’t talk to me.” Communication should be a two-way street, so encourage responses, not barriers.\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Stay consistent**: Once you find a format that works, stick to it. Consistency not only fosters recognition but also nurtures trust over time.\n    \n      \n    \n\n  \nAs in the offline world, every great conversation starts with a warm introduction. Personalizing your ‘From’ line lays the groundwork for a valuable relationship with your recipient!\n\n  \n\nSubject Line: The Key to Unlocking Interest in Cold Emailing\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAny online search on improving your emails will always come back with one piece of core advice: **Optimize your subject line.**\n\n  \n\nAnd it’s true.\n\n  \n\n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    Subject lines with numbers increase [open rates by 57%](https://www.zippia.com/advice/email-subject-line-statistics/#:~:text=Email%20subject%20lines%20with%20numbers,the%20most%2C%20at%2017%25.)\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    Subject lines with 61-70 characters are read most\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    [64% of people](https://www.mailmodo.com/guides/email-subject-line-statistics/)\n     will decide whether they want to open an email or not based on the subject line\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    [69% of people](https://financesonline.com/email-subject-line-statistics/)\n     will report emails as spam based on the subject line alone\n    \n      \n    \n\n  \nWe know, as people, we’re not supposed to judge a book by its cover, but we do, and the subject line is our email’s cover.\n\n  \n\nIt’s the definitive make-or-break element contributing to the success rate of your campaign.

Here are a few tips to make your proposal stand out:\n\n  \n\n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Exclusive benefits**: Emphasize any exclusive perks your recipient will gain, such as early access, limited-time pricing, or personalized features.\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Address pain points**: Identify and target the recipient’s unique challenges and showcase how your solution alleviates them.\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Social proof**: Incorporate testimonials, customer success stories, or even statistics to demonstrate the impact of your offer.\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Low commitment:** Minimize the risk or effort required by the recipient. Offer free trials, easy onboarding, or even a simple way to explore your product or service.\n    \n      \n    \n\n  \nWith a powerful email body that balances personalization and value, your cold emails can turn prospects into opportunities and forge relationships built on trust and relevance!\n\n  \n\nPersonalization and Customization Tactics\n-----------------------------------------\n\n[What is personalization?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U39SZCB_i9w&pp=ygUPcGVyc29uYWxpemF0aW9u)\n\n  \n\nThe significant role of personalization in email marketing is undeniable, especially in the context of cold emailing.\n\n  \n\nAdvanced personalization techniques go beyond simply inserting the recipient’s name in the email and provide a truly individualized message that resonates with the recipient’s needs, interests, and behaviors.\n\n  \n\nThis could look like anything like this:\n\n  \n\n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Custom Fields:** Use custom fields not only for names but also for company name, industry type, recent activities, etc. This will allow you to provide a contextually relevant message for each unique recipient.\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Similarity Appeal**: Leverage the power of shared interests or experiences. If you and the recipient went to the same university or share a common professional background, mentioning this can strengthen your connection.\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Behavioral Personalization**: If you have data about your recipient’s behaviors (downloads, page visits, past purchases), utilize it to contextualize your message.\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Hyper-Targeted Content**: Create content based on the recipient’s industry or professional role. For instance, a CTO might be more interested in the technical aspects of your offer, while a CFO might be more concerned about the cost and return on investment.\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Trigger-Based Emails**: These are emails sent out in response to specific actions. If a prospect visits a particular page on your website, tailor your message to reflect their potential interest related to that visit.\n    \n      \n    \n\n  \nCritically, these techniques should be applied strategically — the aim is to show understanding and add value, not to demonstrate how much you know about the recipient.\n\n  \n\nWhen done right, advanced personalization can greatly enhance the efficacy of your cold emailing initiatives, leading to increased engagement, improved response rates, and a better return on investment in your marketing efforts.\n\n  \n\nUse tools to your advantage as well. AI SDRs like [Artisan's Ava](https://www.artisan.co/ai-sales-agent)\n can help automate this process by ghostwriting bespoke emails for clients on behalf of key team members.\n\n  \n\nHere are a few key advanced personalization techniques:\n\n  \n\n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Segmentation**: Divide your email list into smaller segments based on common characteristics such as industry, job role, interests, or behavior. Craft a unique message for each segment, addressing their specific needs and concerns.\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Dynamic Content**: Use dynamic content to alter parts of the email based on the recipient’s information or preferences.\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Contextual Personalization**: Contextualize your message based on recent interactions, such as a downloaded piece of content or a recent purchase by the recipient.\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Predictive Personalization**: Use predictive analytics and artificial intelligence tools to anticipate the recipient’s needs and preferences and then tailor your message accordingly.\n    \n      \n    \n\n### **Role of Prospecting in Successful Cold Emailing**\n\nProspecting is arguably one of the most critical aspects of successful cold emailing. It lays the groundwork for personalization and ensures your outreach remains relevant and valuable to the recipient.\n\n  \n\nAgain, cold emailing is not spam, as many people believe.\n\n  \n\nInstead, it’s about identifying prospects, highlighting the most suitable ones who are not only profitable but actually suited to work with you, and then hyper-targeting them with your cold email strategies.\n\n  \n\nThe process of prospecting covers the whole topic, including identifying potential customers, understanding their interests and challenges, and aligning these insights with your product or service.\n\n  \n\nHere’s how prospecting directly ties into successful cold emailing:\n\n  \n\n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Better Segmentation**: Efficient prospecting leads to better segmentation of your audience based on common characteristics, enabling you to craft targeted messages.\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Effective Personalization:** With knowledge about a lead’s industry, role, interests, or pain points, you can tailor your email to their unique situation.\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Higher Response Rates**: When sending emails to people interested in what you’re offering, you’re likely to observe higher response rates.\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Quality Conversations**: Prospecting ensures your leads are qualified, making your conversations more meaningful and your efforts more fruitful.\n    \n      \n    \n\n  \nBe smart about your prospecting, take a deep dive into advanced personalization techniques, and you will quickly supercharge your cold emailing effectiveness.\n\n  \n\nCold Email Templates for Different Goals\n----------------------------------------\n\n![37](https://www.artisan.co/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.ctfassets.net%2Fkyprwggh4muz%2F7l7IU1cKEZuN6oZ1flUL8j%2Fb08d220c38d672d7de7c8ef17a25272c%2F37.png&w=3840&q=75)\n\nAt this point, you should have a substantial idea of how to go about the cold emailing process and how to make it work for you.\n\n  \n\nTo help bring a little more clarity to what these ideas look like in action, here are three different cold email templates tailored to various purposes: sales, networking, and recruiting. Each email is crafted with attention to relevance, personalization, and clarity.\n\n  \n\n### **Sales Cold Email**\n\nSubject: \\[Recipient’s Name\\], Boost \\[Business Improvement\\] With \\[Your Product/Service\\]\n\n  \n\n_Melissa, It’s Time to Bring Your Projects Together With One Simple App_\n\n  \n\nDear \\[Recipient’s Name\\],\n\n  \n\nMy name is \\[Your Name\\], and I’m with \\[Your Company\\].\n\n  \n\nI noticed that \\[Recipient’s Company\\] is doing some remarkable work in the field of \\[Industry or Specialty\\], particularly \\[Specific Project or Initiative\\].\n\n  \n\nI’m reaching out because \\[Your Company\\] assists businesses like yours in \\[specific need relevant to them\\], and I believe our \\[Product/Service\\] could significantly enhance this aspect of your operations.\n\n  \n\nTo demonstrate the possible impact, \\[describe a brief success story or statistic\\].\n\n  \n\nIf this sounds appealing, I’d love to arrange a call or meeting to discuss this further.\n\n  \n\nThank you for your time,\n\n  \n\n\\[Your Name\\]\n\n  \n\n\\[Your Contact Information\\]\n\n  \n\n### **Cold Emails for Networking**\n\nSubject: Hello \\[Recipient’s Name\\], Inspired By Your Work On \\[Project/Article\\]\n\n  \n\nDear \\[Recipient’s Name\\],\n\n  \n\nI recently came across \\[mention the project, article, or event you admired\\] and was highly impressed by your work.\n\n  \n\nI am \\[Your Name\\], a \\[Your Position\\] at \\[Your Company\\]. Like you, I’m passionate about \\[shared interest or field\\].\n\n  \n\nI’d welcome the chance to converse further, exchange ideas, and learn more about your journey and success in \\[shared interest or field\\]. If you have some time in the near future, could we arrange a quick call or coffee meet-up?\n\n  \n\nLooking forward to connecting.\n\n  \n\nBest,\n\n  \n\n\\[Your Name\\]\n\n  \n\n\\[Your Contact Information\\]\n\n  \n\n### **Cold Emails for Recruiting**\n\nSubject: \\[Recipient’s Name\\], Your Expertise Matches Perfectly With An Opportunity At \\[Your Company\\]\n\n  \n\nDear \\[Recipient’s Name\\],\n\n  \n\nI am \\[Your Name\\], the \\[Your Position\\] at \\[Your Company\\]. I happened upon your profile and was highly impressed by your background and experience in \\[Specific Skill or Area of Expertise\\].\n\n  \n\nI’d love to discuss an opportunity at our team that aligns perfectly with your skill set and interests. Please don’t worry; this isn’t a mass recruitment email – I’m reaching out based on your exceptional profile and achievements.\n\n  \n\nWould you be open to a brief conversation to explore this opportunity further?\n\n  \n\nBest regards,\n\n  \n\n\\[Your Name\\]\n\n  \n\n\\[Your Contact Information\\]\n\n  \n\nRemember to adapt each of these templates based on your unique context and the recipient’s profile to best suit your outreach goals.\n\n  \n\nFollow-ups: Persistence Pays\n----------------------------\n\n![38](https://www.artisan.co/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.ctfassets.net%2Fkyprwggh4muz%2F65aFfXcOquqaKSUlvmkyvx%2F9f658ca0060bb4d8e8723465ae54616d%2F38.png&w=3840&q=75)\n\nMoving past the actual writing and sending process, cold emails are never a one-and-done process. Follow-ups are an essential tool you need to use to your advantage.\n\n  \n\nStatistics show the first follow-up email offers the highest reply rate out of [all emails at 40%](https://woodpecker.co/blog/follow-up-statistics/#:~:text=The%20first%20follow%2Dup%20email,average%20reply%20rate%20to%208.5%25.)\n. This statistic that accentuates one fact – persistence indeed pays when it comes to cold emails.\n\n  \n\nLet’s explore the art of following up and the apparatus that can make this task more productive.\n\n  \n\n### **Decoding the Art of Following Up**\n\nFollow-ups are more than just sending repeated emails; they are strategic nudges to stimulate action. The fundamental principles include:\n\n  \n\n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Respectful Persistence**: Be persistent but considerate. Wait for a reasonable period before your first follow-up, typically three to five business days after the original email.\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Variety in Content**: Your follow-up should not merely repeat your initial email. Add substance to your message or provide consequential details missing in the first email.\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Limit the Frequency**: While persistence is good, flooding their inbox might come off as desperate or even spammy. As a rule of thumb, limit yourself to three follow-ups after the initial email.\n    \n      \n    \n\n### **Tools and Techniques for Crafting Effective Follow-up Emails**\n\nSeveral tools on the market automate the follow-up process. Examples include [Artisan AI](https://artisan.co/ava-sales-rep/)\n, Reply.io, Woodpecker, and Mailshake. Artisan-AI can also book meetings and manage potential customers’ inquiries on your behalf.\n\n  \n\nThese tools ensure your follow-ups are systematic and timely, offering you control over your email send-out content, frequency, and overall management.\n\n  \n\nWhen crafting your follow-up email, remember to:\n\n  \n\n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Reference the Original Email**: Bring the recipient’s memory back to your original message. Mention the date or content to establish the context.\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Emphasize Value**: Make sure each follow-up delivers additional value to the recipient, whether through additional information, resources, or exclusive offers.\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Clear Call-to-Action**: Reinforce your CTA—now is not the time to be vague. Request for an action, such as a response, call, or meeting, directly linked with the purpose of your cold email.\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Polite Close**: Thank your recipient for their time and end the email professionally.\n    \n      \n    \n\n  \nCoining a respectful, well-timed follow-up strategy, equipped with the right tools and techniques, will not just increase your conversion rates—it will do so while respecting your recipient’s time and inboxes!\n\n  \n\nOvercoming Objections and Rejections\n------------------------------------\n\nAh, yes, the part of this process none of us want to think about.\n\n  \n\nThe rejections.\n\n  \n\nNavigating the territory of cold emailing invariably means dealing with rejections and no-responses.\n\n  \n\nEven looking at the statistics we’ve covered today, you can see you very rarely get above a 50% open or reply rate, which means half of the emails you’re sending out will get absolutely nothing back.\n\n  \n\nAnd that’s average.\n\n  \n\nYes, it can feel disheartening and as though all your hard work is for nothing. However, instead of seeing these obstacles as setbacks, it’s crucial to do the opposite. Approach these hurdles not as opportunities for garnering insights, refining your strategy, and strengthening your approach.\n\n  \n\nLet’s get into it.\n\n  \n\n### **Dealing with No Responses or Rejections**\n\nNo-responses or rejections can occur due to various factors:\n\n  \n\n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    Your email might lack relevance\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    The recipient could be too busy\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    Maybe your value proposition isn’t compelling enough.\n    \n      \n    \n\n  \nThese scenarios aren’t failures but valuable feedback.\n\n  \n\n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Assess and Adapt:** Use these occurrences to re-evaluate your email’s content, personalization level, and value proposition. Make necessary changes based on your assessment.\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Follow-Up**: If your carefully crafted and personalized email garners no response, consider sending a follow-up email. Declines should be respected, but silence might simply imply that your email got lost in their inbox.\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Stay Positive**: Understand that rejection is a part of the sales process. Maintain a positive attitude, and remember not to take rejections personally.\n    \n      \n    \n\n### **Strategies for Alleviating Concerns and Convincing Prospects**\n\nIf you do get a response, but it doesn’t feel positive and more like the prospect is just full of doubt and uncertainty about what you can offer, remember – this is a sign of interest.\n\n  \n\nThey’re simply worried about investing and making the wrong decision. This is where you can step in and take things to the next level.\n\n  \n\nHere’s how you can address them:\n\n  \n\n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Empathize**: Acknowledge their concern and empathize with their situation to build trust.\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Reiterate Value**: Address their objection by reiterating how your product or service can add value.\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Offer Proof**: Use case studies, testimonials, or statistics to validate your claims and alleviate their concerns.\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Propose a Next Step**: Offer a demo, free trial, or consultation to let them experience your offering first-hand.\n    \n      \n    \n\n  \nEach objection is an opportunity in disguise. Your ability to comprehend and efficiently address the concerns expressed could well be your ticket to conversion.\n\n  \n\nMeasurement, Analysis, and Optimization of Cold Emailing\n--------------------------------------------------------\n\n![39](https://www.artisan.co/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.ctfassets.net%2Fkyprwggh4muz%2FGqGOdLfWYe14kpIKAVKZK%2Fa6e2aa922ea162fb4c20959f711c476d%2F39.png&w=3840&q=75)\n\nAnd finally, we come to the end of our masterclass, but there is but one section left to cover.\n\n  \n\nThe metrics.\n\n  \n\nTo ensure your cold emailing strategy’s success, you must measure its performance, analyze the data, and constantly optimize your approach.\n\n  \n\nThese days, data is everything. Instead of roaming around in the dark, making decisions based on gut instincts or pure guesswork, data can show you precisely what people are like, what they want, how to give it to them, what works best, and so much more.\n\n  \n\nIt goes without saying that the success and effectiveness of cold emailing campaigns is often quantified using key metrics. Here are some essential metrics you should track:\n\n  \n\n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Open Rate:** This indicates the percentage of recipients who opened your email. A low open rate might signify that your subject line isn’t compelling enough or that your email lands in the spam folder.\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Click-Through Rate (CTR)**: This refers to the percentage of recipients who clicked on a link within your email. A low CTR might indicate less engaging content or a non-compelling call to action.\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Response Rate:** This measures the percentage of recipients who respond to your email. A low response rate may imply a lack of personalization or relevance in your message.\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Bounce Rate:** This reveals the percentage of emails not successfully delivered to the recipient’s inbox. A high rate might indicate an outdated email list.\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Conversion Rate:** This is the percentage of email recipients who completed a desired action, such as signing up for a demo or purchasing.\n    \n      \n    \n\n  \nThrough data, you’ll be able to see exactly what you’re doing right (thus, you can double down on it) and precisely what isn’t working (and thus bringing clarity to what you can improve).\n\n  \n\n### **Learning from Successes and Failures for Continuous Improvement**\n\nMeasurement alone is not enough; it’s essential to analyze this data and derive actionable insights:\n\n  \n\n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Identify Trends**: Look for patterns in your email performance. Which subject lines led to higher open rates? Which content inspired more responses?\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **A/B Testing**: Test different formulations of your email messages, subject lines, CTAs, and send times to see what works best for your audience.\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Segment Analysis:** Analyze your performance with different audience segments. Are there segments with which your emails perform particularly well or poorly?\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Optimize Based on Feedback**: Pay attention to your prospects’ feedback, comments, and objections. Use this as a source of learning and optimization.\n    \n      \n    \n\n  \nContinuous improvement should be the endgame of every cold emailing strategy. Measure the performance, understand what the metrics are telling you, learn from both your successes and failures, and continually optimize your approach based on these insights.\n\n  \n\nRemember, the goal of optimizing your cold emailing strategy is not just about improving your metrics; it’s about refining your prospect’s experience at every touchpoint, personalizing your communication effectively, and ultimately driving successful actions that align with your broader business objectives.\n\n  \n\nFinal Remarks: The Future of Cold Emailing\n------------------------------------------\n\nAs we sail through the swiftly transforming digital environment, the trajectory of cold emailing continuously evolves, gravitating toward the escalating demands of personalization, relevance, and authenticity.

Cold emailing is a legitimate business practice used for outreach, marketing, or networking. It’s important, however, to ensure they’re done professionally, respecting the recipient’s time and inboxes.\n\n  \n\n### **Can You Get Banned for Cold Emailing?**\n\nIf you’re not careful, your email service provider or the recipient’s email service provider might limit your sending abilities if you send too many cold emails at once or if a significant number of your emails are marked as spam.\n\n  \n\n### **Is Cold Emailing Spamming?**\n\nCold emailing isn’t the same as spamming if done correctly. Unlike spam, an adequately executed cold email is targeted, personalized, and provides value to the recipient.\n\n  \n\nHowever, it can be considered spam if it’s unsolicited, irrelevant, or sent in bulk to unsuspecting recipients.\n\n  \n\n### **What Should I Not Say in a Cold Email?**\n\nAvoid vague or misleading subject lines, don’t use excessive jargon or overly sales-oriented language, and never misrepresent yourself or your intentions. It’s also important not to pressure the recipient excessively.\n\n  \n\n### **Is Cold Emailing Illegal (UK/US)?**\n\nIn both the UK and the US, cold emailing is legal, provided you respect specific regulations. In the UK, it must comply with the Privacy and Electronic Communications Regulations (PECR) and, in the US, the CAN-SPAM Act.\n\n  \n\n### **Is Cold Emailing Against GDPR?**\n\nThe General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) doesn’t prohibit cold emailing but stipulates that you need a lawful basis for processing someone’s personal data.\n\n  \n\nIf you’re cold-emailing within the EU or emailing EU citizens, you need to ensure your practices comply with these regulations—for example, by providing clear ways for recipients to opt out or unsubscribe.\n\n  \n\nShare Article\n\n![copy-link](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/copy-link.svg)[![copy-link](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/mail.svg)](mailto:?body=https://www.artisan.co/blog/the-cold-emailing-masterclass-the-complete-guide-to-skyrocketing-leads-sales)\n\nYou might also like\n-------------------\n\nReady to Supercharge Your Outbound?\n-----------------------------------\n\nOur AI-first platform equips your team with best-in-class outbound tools and our AI BDR Ava, who automates your entire outbound workflow.\n\nPhone\n\nGet Started\n\n### Products\n\n*   [Artisan Sales Overview](/sales-ai)\n    \n*   [Ava, the AI Sales Agent](/ai-sales-agent)\n    \n*   [B2B Data](/products/b2b-data)\n    \n*   [Sales Playbooks](/products/sales-playbooks)\n    \n*   [Email Warmup](/products/email-warmup)\n    \n*   [Sales Automation](/products/sales-automation)\n    \n\n### Resources\n\n*   [Blog](/blog)\n    \n*   [Demos](/watch-demo)\n    \n*   [Support](https://support.artisan.co/)\n    \n*   [Case Studies](/casestudies)\n    \n*   ChangelogSoon\n    \n\n### Solutions\n\n*   [Enterprise](/solutions/enterprise)\n    \n*   [Midmarket](/solutions/midmarket)\n    \n*   [Startups](/solutions/startups)\n    \n*   Lead Gen AgenciesSoon\n    \n\n### Company\n\n*   [About Us](/about)\n    \n*   [Contact Us](/contact-us)\n    \n*   [Careers](/careers)\n    \n*   Artisan LabsSoon\n    \n\n![artisan-logo](https://www.artisan.co/_next/image?url=%2Fassets%2Flogo.webp&w=384&q=75)\n\n© 2024 Artisan AI Inc.

However, times have changed, and so has the essence of cold emails.\n\n  \n\nToday’s cold emailing landscape is all about relationship building, where the focus is centered on nurturing genuine connections, addressing recipients’ needs, and opening the door to mutually beneficial partnerships.\n\n  \n\n_It’s all about_ **_value_**_._\n\n  \n\nSo, we’ve set the scene, and class is now in session. This is the complete and comprehensive guide to cold emailing. After this, you’ll never send an email in the same way again.\n\n  \n\nWith a fresh perspective, cold emailing can evolve into a powerful tool in your business arsenal capable of influencing prospects and creating lasting impressions.\n\n  \n\nLet’s get into it.\n\n  \n\nWhat is Cold Emailing?\n----------------------\n\n![31](https://www.artisan.co/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.ctfassets.net%2Fkyprwggh4muz%2Fj7tMTrxRbEtnxaIOpDeFf%2F6e339f5b70dbff848a3d07c2283b78c3%2F31.png&w=3840&q=75)\n\nCold emailing is a strategy where you send an outreach message to a contact with whom you’ve had no prior interaction.\n\n  \n\nDespite many likening cold emailing to unsolicited spam, in 2023, the dynamics of cold emailing have taken a turn, further highlighting its effectiveness when used correctly.\n\n  \n\n_Emphasis on the “_**_correctly_**_.”_\n\n  \n\nLet’s look at the stats.\n\n  \n\n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    [43% of salespeople](https://blog.hubspot.com/sales/hubspot-sales-strategy-report?hubs_content=blog.hubspot.com%2Fsales%2Fsubject-line-stats-open-rates-slideshare&hubs_content-cta=HubSpot%E2%80%99s%202023%20Sales%20Trends%20Report&__hstc=210964170.570d08a167d0d5dd052b867f69b2113a.1698136652776.1698136652776.1698136652776.1&__hssc=210964170.1.1698136652776&__hsfp=780687628)\n     state that email is the most effective sales channel\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    80% of buyers prefer email contact, with [71% open to receiving emails](https://www.rainsalestraining.com/blog/b2b-sales-funnel-stages)\n     when they’re looking to improve their business results\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    [62% of prospects](https://www.rainsalestraining.com/blog/b2b-sales-funnel-stages)\n     open emails when they’re looking for solutions\n    \n      \n    \n\n  \nYet, the facts show that sales teams are still not providing the experience people want with their emails, and understanding this makes it crystal clear why so many people cry that their emails don’t work.\n\n  \n\nFor example, 81% of all emails are opened on a mobile device, yet only [20% of email campaigns](https://www.superoffice.com/blog/b2b-email-marketing-report/)\n are optimized for said devices.\n\n  \n\nOkay, so what’s going on?\n\n  \n\nEmail is the most effective channel, [boasting a 420% ROI,](https://www.luisazhou.com/blog/email-marketing-roi-statistics/)\n yet open rates are low despite people actively opening emails when they’re in the market for a purchase. Still, marketers are creating email campaigns that don’t work.\n\n  \n\nIt’s pretty clear that there’s a lapse in knowledge and understanding between marketers, salespeople, and their customers. A lot of marketers continue to use tactics that simply do not work.\n\n  \n![32](https://www.artisan.co/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.ctfassets.net%2Fkyprwggh4muz%2FLsYOrjeyZYBZ14DI4h0Di%2F834f5c5d8f664911c03b5b95fd64d29e%2F32.png&w=3840&q=75)\n\nPut it this way: have you tried to spruce up your email subject lines by putting emojis in them?\n\n  \n\nLots of people have, yet emails have a [1.84% higher open rate](https://www.getresponse.com/resources/reports/email-marketing-benchmarks)\n WITHOUT emojis. Alternatively, personalized a subject line with the prospect’s name boosts [it to 43%](https://blog.klenty.com/cold-email-statistics/)\n.\n\n  \n\nWhen it comes to you and your sales efforts, be proactive about knowing the industry, its trends, and what potential customers, prospects, and clients actually want. Then, tailor your efforts towards that.\n\n  \n\nAnd no, it’s not spam or simply sending out as many emails as possible and playing a numbers game. It’s a targeted strategy used exclusively for qualified leads intended to add value and relevance to the recipient’s inbox.\n\n  \n\nLet’s break it down:\n\n  \n\n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Proactive, Not Indiscriminate**: Cold emails are sent explicitly to qualified leads, aligning with their interests and needs. On the contrary, spam emails are sent randomly to a large audience base without considering relevance at heart.\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Personalized Approach**: Effective cold emails are personalized, catering distinctly to the recipient, while spam emails are bulk messages with identical content for thousands of recipients.\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Valuable, Not Misleading:** While spam emails often contain misleading or malicious content, cold emails aim to provide information, add value, and initiate real conversations.\n    \n      \n    \n\n  \nWith a modern approach like this, cold emails have established themselves as an easy, highly ROI-driven, and scalable outreach strategy.\n\n  \n\nCold emailing is becoming even more effective with the rise of AI technology, helping with faster, more succinct content generation and automation of the more mundane and tedious tasks. [Artisan AI Sales Reps](/ai-sales-agent)\n, for example, come with 265 million built-in contacts and automate processes like ghostwriting emails and responding to prospects’ questions.\n\n  \n\nCold emails have moved on from their traditional methods and now lend themselves as instrumental tools not just for sales but for business growth, networking, recruiting, public relations, and market research.\n\n  \n\nThis evolution and range of uses have reimagined cold emails positively, making them a popular choice among marketers and business professionals worldwide.\n\n  \n\nCold Emailing: It’s More than Just Sales\n----------------------------------------\n\n![33](https://www.artisan.co/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.ctfassets.net%2Fkyprwggh4muz%2Fsq6mVlEXTTgPr8SCztEJR%2Fc632c8df55511c0b0b4ea9b6d53313fe%2F33.png&w=3840&q=75)\n\nLet’s face it: we’ve all been on the receiving end of some frosty cold emails.\n\n  \n\nIf you’re grappling with the idea of how to engage your audience without coming off as intrusive, here’s the good news – it’s entirely possible! There are challenges to overcome, which we’ll cover below, alongside lots of actionable methods and strategies to ensure you get the best results.\n\n  \n\nThat’s what we’re focusing on for the rest of this guide, but if you’re looking for fast value, these are the four pillars you need to know when it comes to cold emailing:\n\n  \n\n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Understanding your audience**: Knowing who your recipients are, their pain points, and what drives them helps tailor your emails to resonate personally.\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Offering value**: Always approach cold emails from the angle of delivering value.

Remember, numbers don’t lie!\n    \n      \n    \n\n  \nThese need to apply to everything you do.\n\n  \n\nOh, and remember, cold emailing is more than just a sales instrument. These days, it serves as an ingenious medium to achieve various business objectives. If “diversify” is your motto, cold emailing can be your Swiss army knife.\n\n  \n\nHere’s a glimpse into the versatile use cases for cold emailing:\n\n  \n\n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Networking**: Cold emails help you reach out to industry influencers, thought leaders, or even potential mentors who might otherwise be out of reach.\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Partnerships and Collaborations**: Joint ventures?

This crucial line influences whether a recipient opens your email, dismisses it, or worse, reports it as spam – a decision your prospects will be making in a split-second! Make your impact count.\n\n  \n\nThe ‘From’ line is actually the perfect tool to build trust, establish credibility, and kickstart your relationship with the recipient. The key is to be clear, honest, and leave no room for misunderstanding about who the email is from.\n\n  \n\n### **Personalizing the ‘From’ Line: Best Cold Emailing Practices**\n\nWhen it comes to writing your ‘From’ line, personalization should be your guiding star.\n\n  \n\nHere are a couple of strategies to help you personalize like a pro:\n\n  \n\n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Use your name**: People prefer conversations with other people, not faceless brands. Including your name makes the email feel more personal and trustworthy.\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Use a great profile photo:** A professional headshot that clearly shows your face is a great way to project authority and credibility. Try an [AI headshot generator](https://www.dreamwave.ai/ai-headshots)\n     for one-click professional headshots or [company headshots](https://www.dreamwave.ai/company-headshots)\n    . Or, if you’d like more creative control, an [AI photo generator](https://www.dreamwave.ai/ai-photo-generator)\n     is a great way to prompt specific outfits and backgrounds for your [professional headshots](https://www.dreamwave.ai/ai-headshots)\n    .\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Add your company**: To boost credibility, pair your name with your company’s, like “John from XYZCo.” It’s professional, transparent, and leaves no doubt about your affiliation.\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Avoid no-reply**: Using “no-reply” in your ‘From’ line is the equivalent of saying, “Don’t talk to me.” Communication should be a two-way street, so encourage responses, not barriers.\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Stay consistent**: Once you find a format that works, stick to it. Consistency not only fosters recognition but also nurtures trust over time.\n    \n      \n    \n\n  \nAs in the offline world, every great conversation starts with a warm introduction. Personalizing your ‘From’ line lays the groundwork for a valuable relationship with your recipient!\n\n  \n\nSubject Line: The Key to Unlocking Interest in Cold Emailing\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAny online search on improving your emails will always come back with one piece of core advice: **Optimize your subject line.**\n\n  \n\nAnd it’s true.\n\n  \n\n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    Subject lines with numbers increase [open rates by 57%](https://www.zippia.com/advice/email-subject-line-statistics/#:~:text=Email%20subject%20lines%20with%20numbers,the%20most%2C%20at%2017%25.)\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    Subject lines with 61-70 characters are read most\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    [64% of people](https://www.mailmodo.com/guides/email-subject-line-statistics/)\n     will decide whether they want to open an email or not based on the subject line\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    [69% of people](https://financesonline.com/email-subject-line-statistics/)\n     will report emails as spam based on the subject line alone\n    \n      \n    \n\n  \nWe know, as people, we’re not supposed to judge a book by its cover, but we do, and the subject line is our email’s cover.\n\n  \n\nIt’s the definitive make-or-break element contributing to the success rate of your campaign.

Test multiple variations to see what works best for your audience.\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Keep it short and engaging**: Lengthy subject lines can get cut off, especially on mobile devices. Strive for a succinct and engaging subject line within 50-60 characters.\n    \n      \n    \n\n  \nUltimately, cold email subject lines must evoke interest to garner that all-important click. With the right techniques and a pinch of creativity, your subject lines can reel in your prospects!\n\n  \n\nOne caveat, however – you never want to clickbait people in the spammy sense. Always create a promise and then follow through.\n\n  \n\nHow to Craft an Influential Cold Email Body\n-------------------------------------------\n\n![35](https://www.artisan.co/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.ctfassets.net%2Fkyprwggh4muz%2F18dFDBxyhLOBmMFQbVVTQd%2Fc3732afcb28dcb541da5661617a8e5a4%2F35.png&w=3840&q=75)\n\nOkay, so your prospect has seen who your email is from, and they love your subject line.\n\n  \n\nHowever, these tactics are designed only to open the door. Once a prospect has clicked, this is your chance to establish a connection and offer real value to your recipient.\n\n  \n\nIn essence, it’s the heart and soul of your email.\n\n  \n\nAn impeccably structured email body captures attention and propels the recipient to respond.\n\n  \n\nSo, let’s break down the anatomy of an effective cold email body:\n\n  \n\n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Opening**: Begin with a personalized salutation using the recipient’s name as personalized content can [boost response rates by 32.7%](https://www.klenty.com/blog/cold-email-statistics/)\n    .

Interest-based CTAs, which ask prospective clients if they’d be interested in learning more, can [double email success rates](https://www.klenty.com/blog/cold-email-statistics/)\n    .\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Closing**: Thank the recipient for their time and wrap up the email with a professional closing, like “Best regards” or “Sincerely.” Make sure to include your name and contact information.\n    \n      \n    \n\n### **The Double-Edge Sword of Personalization**\n\nWhile personalization is a powerful tool in the realm of cold emailing, it can also turn into a double-edged sword.\n\n  \n\nOverdoing it comes across as creepy and impersonal, distancing you from your recipient, while undergoing it renders your email generic and bland.\n\n  \n\nThe secret lies in strategic personalization to strike that perfect balance:\n\n  \n\n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    Focus on relevant information, like the recipient’s recent blog post or a shared interest\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    Use the recipient’s name, but avoid overusing it excessively\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    Personalize the subject line and opening sentence, sprinkling in context and rapport-building elements throughout the email\n    \n      \n    \n\n### **Making Your Offer Irresistible**\n\nThe crowning touch on your cold email is rendering your offer utterly irresistible. Here are a few tips to make your proposal stand out:\n\n  \n\n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Exclusive benefits**: Emphasize any exclusive perks your recipient will gain, such as early access, limited-time pricing, or personalized features.\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Address pain points**: Identify and target the recipient’s unique challenges and showcase how your solution alleviates them.\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Social proof**: Incorporate testimonials, customer success stories, or even statistics to demonstrate the impact of your offer.\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Low commitment:** Minimize the risk or effort required by the recipient. Offer free trials, easy onboarding, or even a simple way to explore your product or service.\n    \n      \n    \n\n  \nWith a powerful email body that balances personalization and value, your cold emails can turn prospects into opportunities and forge relationships built on trust and relevance!\n\n  \n\nPersonalization and Customization Tactics\n-----------------------------------------\n\n[What is personalization?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U39SZCB_i9w&pp=ygUPcGVyc29uYWxpemF0aW9u)\n\n  \n\nThe significant role of personalization in email marketing is undeniable, especially in the context of cold emailing.\n\n  \n\nAdvanced personalization techniques go beyond simply inserting the recipient’s name in the email and provide a truly individualized message that resonates with the recipient’s needs, interests, and behaviors.\n\n  \n\nThis could look like anything like this:\n\n  \n\n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Custom Fields:** Use custom fields not only for names but also for company name, industry type, recent activities, etc. This will allow you to provide a contextually relevant message for each unique recipient.\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Similarity Appeal**: Leverage the power of shared interests or experiences. If you and the recipient went to the same university or share a common professional background, mentioning this can strengthen your connection.\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Behavioral Personalization**: If you have data about your recipient’s behaviors (downloads, page visits, past purchases), utilize it to contextualize your message.\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Hyper-Targeted Content**: Create content based on the recipient’s industry or professional role. For instance, a CTO might be more interested in the technical aspects of your offer, while a CFO might be more concerned about the cost and return on investment.\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Trigger-Based Emails**: These are emails sent out in response to specific actions. If a prospect visits a particular page on your website, tailor your message to reflect their potential interest related to that visit.\n    \n      \n    \n\n  \nCritically, these techniques should be applied strategically — the aim is to show understanding and add value, not to demonstrate how much you know about the recipient.\n\n  \n\nWhen done right, advanced personalization can greatly enhance the efficacy of your cold emailing initiatives, leading to increased engagement, improved response rates, and a better return on investment in your marketing efforts.\n\n  \n\nUse tools to your advantage as well. AI SDRs like [Artisan's Ava](https://www.artisan.co/ai-sales-agent)\n can help automate this process by ghostwriting bespoke emails for clients on behalf of key team members.\n\n  \n\nHere are a few key advanced personalization techniques:\n\n  \n\n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Segmentation**: Divide your email list into smaller segments based on common characteristics such as industry, job role, interests, or behavior. Craft a unique message for each segment, addressing their specific needs and concerns.\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Dynamic Content**: Use dynamic content to alter parts of the email based on the recipient’s information or preferences.\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Contextual Personalization**: Contextualize your message based on recent interactions, such as a downloaded piece of content or a recent purchase by the recipient.\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Predictive Personalization**: Use predictive analytics and artificial intelligence tools to anticipate the recipient’s needs and preferences and then tailor your message accordingly.\n    \n      \n    \n\n### **Role of Prospecting in Successful Cold Emailing**\n\nProspecting is arguably one of the most critical aspects of successful cold emailing. It lays the groundwork for personalization and ensures your outreach remains relevant and valuable to the recipient.\n\n  \n\nAgain, cold emailing is not spam, as many people believe.\n\n  \n\nInstead, it’s about identifying prospects, highlighting the most suitable ones who are not only profitable but actually suited to work with you, and then hyper-targeting them with your cold email strategies.\n\n  \n\nThe process of prospecting covers the whole topic, including identifying potential customers, understanding their interests and challenges, and aligning these insights with your product or service.\n\n  \n\nHere’s how prospecting directly ties into successful cold emailing:\n\n  \n\n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Better Segmentation**: Efficient prospecting leads to better segmentation of your audience based on common characteristics, enabling you to craft targeted messages.\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Effective Personalization:** With knowledge about a lead’s industry, role, interests, or pain points, you can tailor your email to their unique situation.\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Higher Response Rates**: When sending emails to people interested in what you’re offering, you’re likely to observe higher response rates.\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Quality Conversations**: Prospecting ensures your leads are qualified, making your conversations more meaningful and your efforts more fruitful.\n    \n      \n    \n\n  \nBe smart about your prospecting, take a deep dive into advanced personalization techniques, and you will quickly supercharge your cold emailing effectiveness.\n\n  \n\nCold Email Templates for Different Goals\n----------------------------------------\n\n![37](https://www.artisan.co/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.ctfassets.net%2Fkyprwggh4muz%2F7l7IU1cKEZuN6oZ1flUL8j%2Fb08d220c38d672d7de7c8ef17a25272c%2F37.png&w=3840&q=75)\n\nAt this point, you should have a substantial idea of how to go about the cold emailing process and how to make it work for you.\n\n  \n\nTo help bring a little more clarity to what these ideas look like in action, here are three different cold email templates tailored to various purposes: sales, networking, and recruiting. Each email is crafted with attention to relevance, personalization, and clarity.\n\n  \n\n### **Sales Cold Email**\n\nSubject: \\[Recipient’s Name\\], Boost \\[Business Improvement\\] With \\[Your Product/Service\\]\n\n  \n\n_Melissa, It’s Time to Bring Your Projects Together With One Simple App_\n\n  \n\nDear \\[Recipient’s Name\\],\n\n  \n\nMy name is \\[Your Name\\], and I’m with \\[Your Company\\].\n\n  \n\nI noticed that \\[Recipient’s Company\\] is doing some remarkable work in the field of \\[Industry or Specialty\\], particularly \\[Specific Project or Initiative\\].\n\n  \n\nI’m reaching out because \\[Your Company\\] assists businesses like yours in \\[specific need relevant to them\\], and I believe our \\[Product/Service\\] could significantly enhance this aspect of your operations.\n\n  \n\nTo demonstrate the possible impact, \\[describe a brief success story or statistic\\].\n\n  \n\nIf this sounds appealing, I’d love to arrange a call or meeting to discuss this further.\n\n  \n\nThank you for your time,\n\n  \n\n\\[Your Name\\]\n\n  \n\n\\[Your Contact Information\\]\n\n  \n\n### **Cold Emails for Networking**\n\nSubject: Hello \\[Recipient’s Name\\], Inspired By Your Work On \\[Project/Article\\]\n\n  \n\nDear \\[Recipient’s Name\\],\n\n  \n\nI recently came across \\[mention the project, article, or event you admired\\] and was highly impressed by your work.\n\n  \n\nI am \\[Your Name\\], a \\[Your Position\\] at \\[Your Company\\]. Like you, I’m passionate about \\[shared interest or field\\].\n\n  \n\nI’d welcome the chance to converse further, exchange ideas, and learn more about your journey and success in \\[shared interest or field\\]. If you have some time in the near future, could we arrange a quick call or coffee meet-up?\n\n  \n\nLooking forward to connecting.\n\n  \n\nBest,\n\n  \n\n\\[Your Name\\]\n\n  \n\n\\[Your Contact Information\\]\n\n  \n\n### **Cold Emails for Recruiting**\n\nSubject: \\[Recipient’s Name\\], Your Expertise Matches Perfectly With An Opportunity At \\[Your Company\\]\n\n  \n\nDear \\[Recipient’s Name\\],\n\n  \n\nI am \\[Your Name\\], the \\[Your Position\\] at \\[Your Company\\]. I happened upon your profile and was highly impressed by your background and experience in \\[Specific Skill or Area of Expertise\\].\n\n  \n\nI’d love to discuss an opportunity at our team that aligns perfectly with your skill set and interests. Please don’t worry; this isn’t a mass recruitment email – I’m reaching out based on your exceptional profile and achievements.\n\n  \n\nWould you be open to a brief conversation to explore this opportunity further?\n\n  \n\nBest regards,\n\n  \n\n\\[Your Name\\]\n\n  \n\n\\[Your Contact Information\\]\n\n  \n\nRemember to adapt each of these templates based on your unique context and the recipient’s profile to best suit your outreach goals.\n\n  \n\nFollow-ups: Persistence Pays\n----------------------------\n\n![38](https://www.artisan.co/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.ctfassets.net%2Fkyprwggh4muz%2F65aFfXcOquqaKSUlvmkyvx%2F9f658ca0060bb4d8e8723465ae54616d%2F38.png&w=3840&q=75)\n\nMoving past the actual writing and sending process, cold emails are never a one-and-done process. Follow-ups are an essential tool you need to use to your advantage.\n\n  \n\nStatistics show the first follow-up email offers the highest reply rate out of [all emails at 40%](https://woodpecker.co/blog/follow-up-statistics/#:~:text=The%20first%20follow%2Dup%20email,average%20reply%20rate%20to%208.5%25.)\n. This statistic that accentuates one fact – persistence indeed pays when it comes to cold emails.\n\n  \n\nLet’s explore the art of following up and the apparatus that can make this task more productive.\n\n  \n\n### **Decoding the Art of Following Up**\n\nFollow-ups are more than just sending repeated emails; they are strategic nudges to stimulate action. The fundamental principles include:\n\n  \n\n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Respectful Persistence**: Be persistent but considerate. Wait for a reasonable period before your first follow-up, typically three to five business days after the original email.\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Variety in Content**: Your follow-up should not merely repeat your initial email. Add substance to your message or provide consequential details missing in the first email.\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Limit the Frequency**: While persistence is good, flooding their inbox might come off as desperate or even spammy. As a rule of thumb, limit yourself to three follow-ups after the initial email.\n    \n      \n    \n\n### **Tools and Techniques for Crafting Effective Follow-up Emails**\n\nSeveral tools on the market automate the follow-up process. Examples include [Artisan AI](https://artisan.co/ava-sales-rep/)\n, Reply.io, Woodpecker, and Mailshake. Artisan-AI can also book meetings and manage potential customers’ inquiries on your behalf.\n\n  \n\nThese tools ensure your follow-ups are systematic and timely, offering you control over your email send-out content, frequency, and overall management.\n\n  \n\nWhen crafting your follow-up email, remember to:\n\n  \n\n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Reference the Original Email**: Bring the recipient’s memory back to your original message. Mention the date or content to establish the context.\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Emphasize Value**: Make sure each follow-up delivers additional value to the recipient, whether through additional information, resources, or exclusive offers.\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Clear Call-to-Action**: Reinforce your CTA—now is not the time to be vague. Request for an action, such as a response, call, or meeting, directly linked with the purpose of your cold email.\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Polite Close**: Thank your recipient for their time and end the email professionally.\n    \n      \n    \n\n  \nCoining a respectful, well-timed follow-up strategy, equipped with the right tools and techniques, will not just increase your conversion rates—it will do so while respecting your recipient’s time and inboxes!\n\n  \n\nOvercoming Objections and Rejections\n------------------------------------\n\nAh, yes, the part of this process none of us want to think about.\n\n  \n\nThe rejections.\n\n  \n\nNavigating the territory of cold emailing invariably means dealing with rejections and no-responses.\n\n  \n\nEven looking at the statistics we’ve covered today, you can see you very rarely get above a 50% open or reply rate, which means half of the emails you’re sending out will get absolutely nothing back.\n\n  \n\nAnd that’s average.\n\n  \n\nYes, it can feel disheartening and as though all your hard work is for nothing. However, instead of seeing these obstacles as setbacks, it’s crucial to do the opposite. Approach these hurdles not as opportunities for garnering insights, refining your strategy, and strengthening your approach.\n\n  \n\nLet’s get into it.\n\n  \n\n### **Dealing with No Responses or Rejections**\n\nNo-responses or rejections can occur due to various factors:\n\n  \n\n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    Your email might lack relevance\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    The recipient could be too busy\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    Maybe your value proposition isn’t compelling enough.\n    \n      \n    \n\n  \nThese scenarios aren’t failures but valuable feedback.\n\n  \n\n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Assess and Adapt:** Use these occurrences to re-evaluate your email’s content, personalization level, and value proposition. Make necessary changes based on your assessment.\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Follow-Up**: If your carefully crafted and personalized email garners no response, consider sending a follow-up email. Declines should be respected, but silence might simply imply that your email got lost in their inbox.\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Stay Positive**: Understand that rejection is a part of the sales process. Maintain a positive attitude, and remember not to take rejections personally.\n    \n      \n    \n\n### **Strategies for Alleviating Concerns and Convincing Prospects**\n\nIf you do get a response, but it doesn’t feel positive and more like the prospect is just full of doubt and uncertainty about what you can offer, remember – this is a sign of interest.\n\n  \n\nThey’re simply worried about investing and making the wrong decision. This is where you can step in and take things to the next level.\n\n  \n\nHere’s how you can address them:\n\n  \n\n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Empathize**: Acknowledge their concern and empathize with their situation to build trust.\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Reiterate Value**: Address their objection by reiterating how your product or service can add value.\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Offer Proof**: Use case studies, testimonials, or statistics to validate your claims and alleviate their concerns.\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Propose a Next Step**: Offer a demo, free trial, or consultation to let them experience your offering first-hand.\n    \n      \n    \n\n  \nEach objection is an opportunity in disguise. Your ability to comprehend and efficiently address the concerns expressed could well be your ticket to conversion.\n\n  \n\nMeasurement, Analysis, and Optimization of Cold Emailing\n--------------------------------------------------------\n\n![39](https://www.artisan.co/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.ctfassets.net%2Fkyprwggh4muz%2FGqGOdLfWYe14kpIKAVKZK%2Fa6e2aa922ea162fb4c20959f711c476d%2F39.png&w=3840&q=75)\n\nAnd finally, we come to the end of our masterclass, but there is but one section left to cover.\n\n  \n\nThe metrics.\n\n  \n\nTo ensure your cold emailing strategy’s success, you must measure its performance, analyze the data, and constantly optimize your approach.\n\n  \n\nThese days, data is everything. Instead of roaming around in the dark, making decisions based on gut instincts or pure guesswork, data can show you precisely what people are like, what they want, how to give it to them, what works best, and so much more.\n\n  \n\nIt goes without saying that the success and effectiveness of cold emailing campaigns is often quantified using key metrics. Here are some essential metrics you should track:\n\n  \n\n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Open Rate:** This indicates the percentage of recipients who opened your email. A low open rate might signify that your subject line isn’t compelling enough or that your email lands in the spam folder.\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Click-Through Rate (CTR)**: This refers to the percentage of recipients who clicked on a link within your email. A low CTR might indicate less engaging content or a non-compelling call to action.\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Response Rate:** This measures the percentage of recipients who respond to your email. A low response rate may imply a lack of personalization or relevance in your message.\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Bounce Rate:** This reveals the percentage of emails not successfully delivered to the recipient’s inbox. A high rate might indicate an outdated email list.\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Conversion Rate:** This is the percentage of email recipients who completed a desired action, such as signing up for a demo or purchasing.\n    \n      \n    \n\n  \nThrough data, you’ll be able to see exactly what you’re doing right (thus, you can double down on it) and precisely what isn’t working (and thus bringing clarity to what you can improve).\n\n  \n\n### **Learning from Successes and Failures for Continuous Improvement**\n\nMeasurement alone is not enough; it’s essential to analyze this data and derive actionable insights:\n\n  \n\n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Identify Trends**: Look for patterns in your email performance. Which subject lines led to higher open rates? Which content inspired more responses?\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **A/B Testing**: Test different formulations of your email messages, subject lines, CTAs, and send times to see what works best for your audience.\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Segment Analysis:** Analyze your performance with different audience segments. Are there segments with which your emails perform particularly well or poorly?\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Optimize Based on Feedback**: Pay attention to your prospects’ feedback, comments, and objections. Use this as a source of learning and optimization.\n    \n      \n    \n\n  \nContinuous improvement should be the endgame of every cold emailing strategy. Measure the performance, understand what the metrics are telling you, learn from both your successes and failures, and continually optimize your approach based on these insights.\n\n  \n\nRemember, the goal of optimizing your cold emailing strategy is not just about improving your metrics; it’s about refining your prospect’s experience at every touchpoint, personalizing your communication effectively, and ultimately driving successful actions that align with your broader business objectives.\n\n  \n\nFinal Remarks: The Future of Cold Emailing\n------------------------------------------\n\nAs we sail through the swiftly transforming digital environment, the trajectory of cold emailing continuously evolves, gravitating toward the escalating demands of personalization, relevance, and authenticity.

Cold emailing is a legitimate business practice used for outreach, marketing, or networking. It’s important, however, to ensure they’re done professionally, respecting the recipient’s time and inboxes.\n\n  \n\n### **Can You Get Banned for Cold Emailing?**\n\nIf you’re not careful, your email service provider or the recipient’s email service provider might limit your sending abilities if you send too many cold emails at once or if a significant number of your emails are marked as spam.\n\n  \n\n### **Is Cold Emailing Spamming?**\n\nCold emailing isn’t the same as spamming if done correctly. Unlike spam, an adequately executed cold email is targeted, personalized, and provides value to the recipient.\n\n  \n\nHowever, it can be considered spam if it’s unsolicited, irrelevant, or sent in bulk to unsuspecting recipients.\n\n  \n\n### **What Should I Not Say in a Cold Email?**\n\nAvoid vague or misleading subject lines, don’t use excessive jargon or overly sales-oriented language, and never misrepresent yourself or your intentions. It’s also important not to pressure the recipient excessively.\n\n  \n\n### **Is Cold Emailing Illegal (UK/US)?**\n\nIn both the UK and the US, cold emailing is legal, provided you respect specific regulations. In the UK, it must comply with the Privacy and Electronic Communications Regulations (PECR) and, in the US, the CAN-SPAM Act.\n\n  \n\n### **Is Cold Emailing Against GDPR?**\n\nThe General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) doesn’t prohibit cold emailing but stipulates that you need a lawful basis for processing someone’s personal data.\n\n  \n\nIf you’re cold-emailing within the EU or emailing EU citizens, you need to ensure your practices comply with these regulations—for example, by providing clear ways for recipients to opt out or unsubscribe.\n\n  \n\nShare Article\n\n![copy-link](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/copy-link.svg)[![copy-link](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/mail.svg)](mailto:?body=https://www.artisan.co/blog/the-cold-emailing-masterclass-the-complete-guide-to-skyrocketing-leads-sales)\n\nYou might also like\n-------------------\n\nReady to Supercharge Your Outbound?\n-----------------------------------\n\nOur AI-first platform equips your team with best-in-class outbound tools and our AI BDR Ava, who automates your entire outbound workflow.\n\nPhone\n\nGet Started\n\n### Products\n\n*   [Artisan Sales Overview](/sales-ai)\n    \n*   [Ava, the AI Sales Agent](/ai-sales-agent)\n    \n*   [B2B Data](/products/b2b-data)\n    \n*   [Sales Playbooks](/products/sales-playbooks)\n    \n*   [Email Warmup](/products/email-warmup)\n    \n*   [Sales Automation](/products/sales-automation)\n    \n\n### Resources\n\n*   [Blog](/blog)\n    \n*   [Demos](/watch-demo)\n    \n*   [Support](https://support.artisan.co/)\n    \n*   [Case Studies](/casestudies)\n    \n*   ChangelogSoon\n    \n\n### Solutions\n\n*   [Enterprise](/solutions/enterprise)\n    \n*   [Midmarket](/solutions/midmarket)\n    \n*   [Startups](/solutions/startups)\n    \n*   Lead Gen AgenciesSoon\n    \n\n### Company\n\n*   [About Us](/about)\n    \n*   [Contact Us](/contact-us)\n    \n*   [Careers](/careers)\n    \n*   Artisan LabsSoon\n    \n\n![artisan-logo](https://www.artisan.co/_next/image?url=%2Fassets%2Flogo.webp&w=384&q=75)\n\n© 2024 Artisan AI Inc.

Since then, we have launched V2 of our platform, onboarded hundreds of companies, and have 13 employees working on our product.\n\n  \n\n**Our investors**\n-----------------\n\nOur round was led by [Oliver Jung](https://www.linkedin.com/in/oliver-jung-465351/?originalSubdomain=mc)\n, an early investor in Airbnb, Rippling, Revolut, and many other unicorns. Other investors include Sequoia Scout, Y Combinator, Soma Capital, BOND Capital, Anu Hariharan, Paul Daversa, Fellow’s Fund, Mento VC and more.\n\n  \n\nWe also raised on an uncapped 20% discount SAFE – meaning the round will convert at a 20% discount to our Series A valuation.\n\n  \n\n**Where we’re going**\n---------------------\n\nStarting with sales, we’re replacing and automating the entire GTM SaaS stack.\n\n  \n\nWe launched our AI Sales Agent, Ava, in February 2023. She automates 80% of a BDR’s role. She operates within our Artisan Sales platform, which replaces 10s of outbound sales tools into a single, consolidated platform. It’s also the only sales software to automate personalized email writing with dynamic email playbooks that can emulate any style a human BDR would write in. In the past few months, we’ve seen strong interest from large B2B SaaS companies who are ready to consolidate their complex, fragmented software stack.\n\n  \n\nNext in our pipeline is Liam, the Marketing Artisan, and James, the Customer Success Artisan.\n\n  \n\nWhile our competitors are building solutions that sit on top of existing software stacks, our vision is to become the go-to platform for GTM SaaS and digital labor. When you’re hiring AI employees, you’re not going to want to also pay for software tools for them to use. We’re at war against context switching, poor UX and manual workflows.\n\n  \n\n**We’ve created levels of AI employee autonomy**\n------------------------------------------------\n\nWe launched V2 of our platform at the beginning of April. This release introduced Level 2 Autonomy of AI Agents, a significant improvement on Level 1, which came out in February 2023. Where Level 1 Ava required manual human review, Level 2 Ava operates on autopilot, independently crafting and sending emails in a variety of styles, without direct human input.\n\n  \n\nThese ‘levels’ are based on the levels of AI agent autonomy, which is a framework central to our vision of a future where AI employees and humans collaborate seamlessly.\n\n  \n\nAt the basic end of the spectrum, where most AI solutions today exist, Level 1 autonomy is where the agent acts upon specific instructions without deviation. Level 2, where Ava currently operates, introduces assisted autonomy, where the system can make certain decisions and perform tasks with minimal human oversight.\n\n  \n\nWe’re currently working on Level 3 autonomy, where AI agents will not only execute tasks but also begin to manage complex decision-making processes within specified scenarios. We will continue to ascend the levels of autonomy until we achieve Level 5 Artisans – AI employees that can perform better than humans in all hard & soft skills associated with a given role.\n\n  \n\n**This is the next Industrial Revolution**\n------------------------------------------\n\nThe complete integration of AI in the office is quickly becoming a reality. Ava currently automates 80% of a Business Development Representative’s (BDR) role. This capability underscores the profound shift in how work is conducted and the role of human workers in the new digital economy.\n\n  \n\nWork is changing forever, and every person’s job responsibilities will change in the next few years. We are at a pivotal time in humankind, and we truly believe we are on the precipice of the next Industrial Revolution. At Artisan, we’re positioning ourselves at the forefront of this AI Renaissance. We will be the leaders in bringing AI employees to the mainstream.\n\n  \n\nOver the next few months, we’re working hard towards raising our Series A, and onboarding as many mid-market and enterprise companies as we can.\n\n  \n\nIf you’re interested in hiring Ava, you can [get in touch here](/talk-to-sales)\n.\n\n  \n\nShare Article\n\n![copy-link](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/copy-link.svg)[![copy-link](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/mail.svg)](mailto:?body=https://www.artisan.co/blog/artisan-raises-7-3-seed-round)\n\nYou might also like\n-------------------\n\nReady to Supercharge Your Outbound?\n-----------------------------------\n\nOur AI-first platform equips your team with best-in-class outbound tools and our AI BDR Ava, who automates your entire outbound workflow.\n\nPhone\n\nGet Started\n\n### Products\n\n*   [Artisan Sales Overview](/sales-ai)\n    \n*   [Ava, the AI Sales Agent](/ai-sales-agent)\n    \n*   [B2B Data](/products/b2b-data)\n    \n*   [Sales Playbooks](/products/sales-playbooks)\n    \n*   [Email Warmup](/products/email-warmup)\n    \n*   [Sales Automation](/products/sales-automation)\n    \n\n### Resources\n\n*   [Blog](/blog)\n    \n*   [Demos](/watch-demo)\n    \n*   [Support](https://support.artisan.co/)\n    \n*   [Case Studies](/casestudies)\n    \n*   ChangelogSoon\n    \n\n### Solutions\n\n*   [Enterprise](/solutions/enterprise)\n    \n*   [Midmarket](/solutions/midmarket)\n    \n*   [Startups](/solutions/startups)\n    \n*   Lead Gen AgenciesSoon\n    \n\n### Company\n\n*   [About Us](/about)\n    \n*   [Contact Us](/contact-us)\n    \n*   [Careers](/careers)\n    \n*   Artisan LabsSoon\n    \n\n![artisan-logo](https://www.artisan.co/_next/image?url=%2Fassets%2Flogo.webp&w=384&q=75)\n\n© 2024 Artisan AI Inc.

If you’re doing outbound sales and still heavily relying on repetitive manual tasks, you’re doing something wrong. If you and your sales team are spending hours researching and writing individual emails to prospects, the ugly truth is that you’re quickly going to fall behind your competitors. It’s not that you’re doing anything wrong per se – it’s just that the numbers simply can’t compare.\n\n  \n\n[According to Operatix](https://www.operatix.net/blogs/sdr-metrics-outbound-inbound-teams/)\n, an outbound SDR books an average of fifteen meetings a month, of which only twelve will actually be completed. That might not seem too bad on its own, but when you consider that most outbound engines consist of tens of SDRs, all being paid handsomely for performing repetitive tasks by hand, it starts to sound majorly suspect.\n\n  \n![Outbound SDR Chart](https://www.artisan.co/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.ctfassets.net%2Fkyprwggh4muz%2F4Zpb4z7kKt6yR9vFf7dHae%2F037554f33d2ccbb68be0e416890a00fe%2FScreenshot_2024-06-28_at_4.15.04_PM.png&w=3840&q=75)\n\n  \n_From Operatix's SDR Metrics Report_\n\n  \n\nSo it should probably come as no surprise that implementing outbound sales automation tools produces compelling results indeed. [Hubspot’s research](https://blog.hubspot.com/sales/sales-automation-stats)\n shows companies that invest in AI and automation software report a 10-20% boost in sales ROI; of the top sellers, 80% use these tools on a regular basis. \n\n  \n\nThese companies aren’t just saving time (though [49% of them](https://www.kixie.com/sales-blog/27-sales-automation-statistics-you-need-to-know-in-2023/)\n say that’s the single biggest benefit). They’re also improving communication and allocating more of their most precious resource – the energy of their employees – towards higher-quality, more challenging tasks. \n\n  \n\nOutbound sales automation isn’t going anywhere, clearly. So it’s probably best if you understand it as deeply as possible. Let’s take a closer look.\n\n  \n\nKey Components of Outbound Sales Automation\n-------------------------------------------\n\n![social media post scraping](https://www.artisan.co/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.ctfassets.net%2Fkyprwggh4muz%2F3WHk3zkXgczmT0rvbVXjdm%2Fc19fa2be883dd6b0ed2cd6e504e7d7ff%2F1__Social_Media_Post_Scrapping.webp&w=3840&q=75)\n\n### Lead Generation and Scoring\n\nWidely considered every rep’s least favorite job, lead generation and qualification is the bedrock of every successful pipeline. But it’s repetitive, it’s boring, and it’s dangerously prone to human error – just try sending an email to a mistyped address and see how far it gets you.\n\n  \n\nAll of these factors make it the ideal task to be automated. By setting out predefined criteria, outbound sales automation programs can gather, organize, and score leads at a scale that humans simply can’t compete with. \n\n  \n\n### Drafting and Sending Personalized Email Sequences and Follow-Up Messages\n\nBefore too long, we’re going to have to retire the phrase “the human touch”, because recent advances in AI have made those lines a whole lot blurrier than they used to be. Using a range of high-tech features, automated sales software is more than capable of developing personalized cold emails and follow-up communications based on customer behavior and preferences. Social media post scraping, for example, makes it possible to get instant insight into a prospect’s mindset and gather intent data at scale, while technographic data can be gathered to see what tech stack they’re currently using. \n\n  \n\nAnd thanks to the increasingly multi-modal nature of these programs, it’s possible to automate the task of following up across several different channels. It’s not just email: social media platforms, text messages and even phone calls can all join the party, saving even more time for sales reps and radically increasing workflow efficiency.\n\n  \n\n### Automate Repetitive Administrative Tasks\n\nData entry. Meeting scheduling. Updating CRM records. To know them is to loathe them, but these dull admin jobs are an essential element in any successful sales engine. Thankfully, we might not need to dread doing them ourselves for much longer.\n\n  \n\nDue to its repetitive nature, this kind of busywork is a prime candidate for automation. There’s little to no independent reasoning required. In most cases, it’s a tick-box exercise where the only criterion for success is not getting anything wrong. And even the best sales professionals make mistakes, especially when they’ve been doing the same task for hours – but machines don’t.\n\n  \n\nOptimizing the Sales Process\n----------------------------\n\n![Email Campaigns](https://www.artisan.co/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.ctfassets.net%2Fkyprwggh4muz%2F2710IAedPcYEoh4qe7e5Mn%2F4354a2bc9a080b4cb2fbe659f1a584ea%2F3__Email_Campaigns.webp&w=3840&q=75)\n\n### Workflow Automation\n\nWhen it comes to optimizing a sales process, there’s no better place to start than at the workflow level. There are a number of different ways automation can be employed, but the most common include automating repetitive tasks (like the ones mentioned above) and designing more efficient, AI-friendly workflows from the ground up. \n\n  \n\nFor example, if a company knows it’s going to be using outbound sales automation software, there’s no reason to train its reps on tasks like data entry or CRM updates. Instead, the workflow could be crafted to work with the AI – effectively using the result of its busywork, double-checking for errors, tweaking personalized cold emails, and so on.\n\n  \n\n**Are you ready to try sales automation on the cutting edge?** [Check out how Ava can automate 80% of your outbound cycle.](https://www.artisan.co/ai-sales-agent)\n She frees up your sales team’s time to focus on the most important thing – closing deals!\n\n  \n\n### Lead Generation and Management\n\nOutbound sales automation software can – and will – revolutionize the way you think about lead generation and lead management. Forget about painstakingly scouring LinkedIn, Google, and other sources to compile a list of prospects. Just set the program up with your ideal customer profile (ICP) and let it do the heavy lifting for you.\n\n  \n\nBut the magic doesn’t stop there. High-end automation software will also pre-qualify the prospects on your lead lists by bounce-testing leads, assessing them against your ideal ICP, and ranking them by priority. As a result, by the time your reps start interacting with them, they already know where to focus most of their time and energy. And with automated enrichment, by the time salespeople interact with the potential customers in their sales pipeline, they’ll already have a wealth of data to draw on.\n\n  \n\n### Email Campaigns and Sequences\n\nHere’s a statistic so ridiculous that it sounds made-up at first. [According to research](https://www.rpeorigin.com/2023/09/2023-new-research-on-enterprise-use-of-ai-in-email/)\n carried out by Ascend2 RPE Origina, running A/B tests on your emails can increase ROI by 82%, from 23:1 all the way to 42:1. A/B testing is just one of several weapons in any outbound sales team’s arsenal – and sales automation software is capable of performing those analyses all on its own.\n\n  \n\nA/B testing isn’t the only way email automation can enhance marketing efforts, though. It can set up, run, and optimize entire outreach campaigns. By drawing on a wealth of customer preference data, sales automation programs can personalize every aspect of the email outreach process. Automated email playbooks can be generated based on what content those customers are most likely to respond to, for example, while real-time email sequences make it possible to interact with each ideal customer at the perfect moment based on past behavior.\n\n  \n\nEnhancing Sales Team Productivity\n---------------------------------\n\n![AI Powered Automation](https://www.artisan.co/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.ctfassets.net%2Fkyprwggh4muz%2F3idsNDo74v1GtZwxaDTGPu%2F9e1ca1e02bb63913ce481caff59ee990%2F4__AI_Powered_Automation.webp&w=3840&q=75)\n\n### Roles of Sales Reps and SDRs\n\nSo far, we’ve focused on the technical nitty-gritty behind what automation software is actually _doing_. But we haven’t discussed the elephant in the room yet. What happens to the reps and SDRs who all of a sudden find they’ve got nothing left to do because it’s all been automated?\n\n  \n\nWell, that’s not quite the case. Sure, sales team members won’t be as busy with time-consuming, manual tasks like lead scoring or churning out follow-up emails. Instead, they’ll be devoting their energy towards high-value sales engagement activities that only they can perform.\n\n  \n\nThe actual art of selling – the cold calling, the back-and-forth, the push-and-pull, the cat and the proverbial mouse – is all still firmly the domain of humans. And because they don’t need to waste time on manual busywork, reps and SDRs will be able to hyper-focus their sales efforts on the tasks that ultimately bring in revenue for their organization. \n\n  \n\nThere’s still a place for traditional sales reps, sales managers, and SDRs. But their role is going to look drastically different from how it used to – more productive, more challenging, and ultimately more rewarding.  \n  \nAnd for companies, the potential for improvement is just as significant. Every manager has wished they could make a dozen copies of their best-performing rep and populate the entire team with them. Well, that’s pretty much possible now, with the ability to replicate the strategies of top-performing salespeople, streamline them, and circulate them across the entire team. By making the most of an automation platform, every BDR can be turned into a top-performing sales rep, radically increasing productivity and efficiency across the board.\n\n  \n\n### Sales Engagement Strategies\n\nAccording to a [2023 study](https://belkins.io/blog/cold-email-response-rates#:~:text=The%20average%20cold%20email%20response,from%206.1%25%20to%202.5%25.)\n carried out by Belkins, cold email reply rates range from as low as 2% in some major industries to as high as 10% in others. Which is less than ideal, given that the ROI for emails can be as [high as 45x](https://www.litmus.com/blog/infographic-the-roi-of-email-marketing)\n. So increasing response rates should obviously be a matter of high priority for any team looking to optimize its sales funnel, schedule more meetings and fill up its pipeline with high-quality potential deals.\n\n  \n![ROI by Industry](https://www.artisan.co/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.ctfassets.net%2Fkyprwggh4muz%2F57P65iiK4Iya3W5a1EL3Cc%2F6500c670082c618fb9219cd78e2c5a20%2FScreenshot_2024-06-28_at_4.26.50_PM.png&w=3840&q=75)\n\n_From Litmus' ROI of Email Marketing Infographic_\n\n  \n\nFortunately, automation can help out here as well. Machine-learning powered outbound sales technology makes personalized outreach possible at a scale humans simply can’t compete with, allowing forward-thinking sales teams to ramp up their volume without needing to sacrifice the individual touch that can often make all the difference.\n\n  \n\nIn a similar vein, consistency, frequency and optimal timing are all elements of the outreach process that can be automated with ease. The potential for ultra-precise segmentation gives every single email the best chance of reaching its ideal customer, while detailed analytics and comprehensive A/B testing functionality makes it possible to improve the overall process in real-time.\n\n  \n\nLeveraging Technology for Sales Success\n---------------------------------------\n\n![Lead Generation + Management](https://www.artisan.co/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.ctfassets.net%2Fkyprwggh4muz%2F3h1R5TefyohGqDH3Zha6bg%2Fed3ba44a36a22248a6a4c9cfbf4404fc%2F2__Lead_Generation___Managemetn.webp&w=3840&q=75)\n\n### AI-Powered Automation\n\nWe’ve already discussed how that outbound sales automation technology is capable of personalizing sales outreach communication at scale. But we haven’t actually discussed what that looks like in practice – and what better real-world example than Artisan’s very own [AI BDR, Ava](https://www.artisan.co/ai-sales-agent)\n?\n\n  \n\nAva’s capable of scraping prospects’ social media posts in order to update her customer profiles with the most recent personal data. For instance, imagine you’re a B2B SaaS company selling HR payroll software. Your ideal customers, in this example, are startups that have just raised funding. Ava, thanks to her Crunchbase integration, will automatically be able to identify startups that have recently raised rounds, enroll them in a workflow, and be the first one in their email inbox with a hyper-personalized message.\n\n  \n\nNow picture that same process happening constantly, across every single prospect you’re working with, without your reps needing to lift a finger. If that’s not a game-changer, we don’t know what is.\n\n  \n\nThe real beauty of AI-powered automation lies in its ability to continuously learn and improve. Predictive analytics, powered by the constant stream of data the software is taking in, makes it possible to discover trends, make informed predictions about future performance and tweak your current strategy for the highest probability of success. And because it’s all powered by AI, the entire process can happen at as large a scale as you need it to.\n\n  \n\n### Integrations and Functionalities\n\nThe modern business world is hyper-connected, so it only stands to reason that sales software should be as well. And as any SDR will be able to tell you, the sheer amount of business tools available these days is nothing short of staggering. Email marketing software, CRMs, data integration suites, analytics programs – the list goes on.\n\n  \n\nWith such a smorgasbord of tools being used on a daily basis, it’s vitally important that outbound sales automation software can integrate with all of them. Switching seamlessly from prospecting software to updating your CRM of choice, drawing on analytics reports to inform cold email outreach: it all works together, and it all _just works_.\n\n  \n\nBut none of that means you should need to completely redesign your existing strategies in order to implement automation technology. The best software will automatically hook into your existing CRM, automatically trawling through your existing insights and re-engaging qualified leads that have gone cold. Next, it’ll update your CRM with ultra-precise, bang up-to-date details like method of engagement, behavior data points, additional insights, and so on.  \n  \nAll of this helps optimize your process and increase your results, and it all happens on auto-pilot, freeing up dozens of hours of manual work that can be redirected towards actively selling instead.\n\n  \n\n**Ready to step into the future of outbound?** [Check out how Ava automates 80% of your outbound cycle.](https://www.artisan.co/ai-sales-agent)\n\n  \n\nMeasuring and Improving Sales Performance\n-----------------------------------------\n\n![Analytics](https://www.artisan.co/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.ctfassets.net%2Fkyprwggh4muz%2F4FEAIRfS7VQpzHLNFAF15m%2Ff5124fa67eb742adb75a5f4f1140c2db%2FScreenshot_2024-06-28_at_5.19.47_PM.png&w=3840&q=75)\n\n### Key Metrics and KPIs\n\nOne of the biggest advantages provided by sales automation tools is their ability to process huge amounts of data.\n\n  \n\n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Conversion Rates.** By analyzing conversion rates at scale across your entire funnel, automation can help identify speed bumps and suggest strategies for fixing the problem, saving you dozens of hours of manual analysis in the process.\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Sales Cycle Time.** Automation can spot the points in the sales cycle that accelerate it the most and help you prioritize them in your process. \n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Lead-to-Close Ratios.** When you use automation to analyze your lead-to-close ratios, you get far deeper insights into areas for optimization thanks to the sheer depth and breadth of the data being mined.\n    \n      \n    \n\n### Continuous Optimization\n\nNot unlike those sharks who never stop moving, if a sales team stops optimizing its process, it’ll fall behind its competitors. Thankfully, outbound sales automation software allows you to improve as you go across the board.  \n  \nWith automation, software will be able to automatically set different campaigns, run tests, and implement improvements based on KPIs and ideal results. We’re essentially entering a new paradigm of continuous and automatic optimization, where sales reps don’t have to manually set and adjust campaigns anymore, and where every major decision throughout the outbound sales process is made based on huge treasure troves of cold, hard data.\n\n  \n\nA Look Ahead to Emerging Tools and Technologies\n-----------------------------------------------\n\n![Ava ](https://www.artisan.co/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.ctfassets.net%2Fkyprwggh4muz%2F1F1K07Hn1H4RBzoqR7Rips%2F290b810b3dfd3f3c30c2529376c62765%2F5__ending.webp&w=3840&q=75)\n\n### AI and Machine Learning\n\nAI and Machine Learning is poised to radically disrupt the current sales landscape – the advantages offered by automation are just too much of a game-changer to ignore. For example, take [Ava, Artisan’s AI BDR](https://www.artisan.co/ai-sales-agent)\n. She’ll be able to automate 80% of a human BDR’s workflow, make her own autonomous decisions, brief you on upcoming meetings, reach out to new prospects, and keep everything meticulously updated in her CRM. By using cutting-edge technology to analyze, implement, and continuously optimize at scale, forward-looking organizations will find themselves at a distinct advantage over any of their competitors who haven’t yet integrated automation into their processes.\n\n  \n\n### Enhanced CRM Capabilities\n\nAs AI continues to improve day-by-day, CRMs are becoming more powerful than ever. Some of the most exciting features include natural language processing, sentiment analysis, real-time decision-making, and even truly sci-fi concepts like recognizing faces or voices via biometric analysis. For a sales rep using the CRM of tomorrow, the workflow is going to be almost unrecognizable. Instead of manually entering lead data and moving the process along by hand, they might simply talk to their software instead, asking for specific insights, the latest updates on their deals, or guidance as to what they should focus on next.  \n  \nThe CRM will be able to suggest the best way for the rep to spend their time based on the current state of the pipeline. Maybe it’s the perfect moment to reach out to that prospect from a couple weeks ago, because sentiment analysis of a recent Tweet has revealed they’re particularly unhappy with their current solution. Or maybe it’s time to strike while the iron is hot on a few new leads, because past insights on leads in a similar industry indicates they respond best to a quick invitation to a product demo. \n\n  \n\nThe possibilities are endless; the potential, staggering. To sum it all up in plain English, it’s an exciting time to be in sales – and the future’s only getting brighter.\n\n  \n\n**Experience cutting-edge sales automation firsthand.** [Hire Ava](https://www.artisan.co/ai-sales-agent)\n and she’ll immediately launch a lead generation campaign just for you, focusing all her efforts on high-quality leads and quick results.\n\n  \n\n  \n\nShare Article\n\n![copy-link](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/copy-link.svg)[![copy-link](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/mail.svg)](mailto:?body=https://www.artisan.co/blog/outbound-sales-automation)\n\nYou might also like\n-------------------\n\nReady to Supercharge Your Outbound?\n-----------------------------------\n\nOur AI-first platform equips your team with best-in-class outbound tools and our AI BDR Ava, who automates your entire outbound workflow.\n\nPhone\n\nGet Started\n\n### Products\n\n*   [Artisan Sales Overview](/sales-ai)\n    \n*   [Ava, the AI Sales Agent](/ai-sales-agent)\n    \n*   [B2B Data](/products/b2b-data)\n    \n*   [Sales Playbooks](/products/sales-playbooks)\n    \n*   [Email Warmup](/products/email-warmup)\n    \n*   [Sales Automation](/products/sales-automation)\n    \n\n### Resources\n\n*   [Blog](/blog)\n    \n*   [Demos](/watch-demo)\n    \n*   [Support](https://support.artisan.co/)\n    \n*   [Case Studies](/casestudies)\n    \n*   ChangelogSoon\n    \n\n### Solutions\n\n*   [Enterprise](/solutions/enterprise)\n    \n*   [Midmarket](/solutions/midmarket)\n    \n*   [Startups](/solutions/startups)\n    \n*   Lead Gen AgenciesSoon\n    \n\n### Company\n\n*   [About Us](/about)\n    \n*   [Contact Us](/contact-us)\n    \n*   [Careers](/careers)\n    \n*   Artisan LabsSoon\n    \n\n![artisan-logo](https://www.artisan.co/_next/image?url=%2Fassets%2Flogo.webp&w=384&q=75)\n\n© 2024 Artisan AI Inc.

High-end automation software will also pre-qualify the prospects on your lead lists by bounce-testing leads, assessing them against your ideal ICP, and ranking them by priority. As a result, by the time your reps start interacting with them, they already know where to focus most of their time and energy. And with automated enrichment, by the time salespeople interact with the potential customers in their sales pipeline, they’ll already have a wealth of data to draw on.\n\n  \n\n### Email Campaigns and Sequences\n\nHere’s a statistic so ridiculous that it sounds made-up at first. [According to research](https://www.rpeorigin.com/2023/09/2023-new-research-on-enterprise-use-of-ai-in-email/)\n carried out by Ascend2 RPE Origina, running A/B tests on your emails can increase ROI by 82%, from 23:1 all the way to 42:1. A/B testing is just one of several weapons in any outbound sales team’s arsenal – and sales automation software is capable of performing those analyses all on its own.\n\n  \n\nA/B testing isn’t the only way email automation can enhance marketing efforts, though. It can set up, run, and optimize entire outreach campaigns. By drawing on a wealth of customer preference data, sales automation programs can personalize every aspect of the email outreach process. Automated email playbooks can be generated based on what content those customers are most likely to respond to, for example, while real-time email sequences make it possible to interact with each ideal customer at the perfect moment based on past behavior.\n\n  \n\nEnhancing Sales Team Productivity\n---------------------------------\n\n![AI Powered Automation](https://www.artisan.co/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.ctfassets.net%2Fkyprwggh4muz%2F3idsNDo74v1GtZwxaDTGPu%2F9e1ca1e02bb63913ce481caff59ee990%2F4__AI_Powered_Automation.webp&w=3840&q=75)\n\n### Roles of Sales Reps and SDRs\n\nSo far, we’ve focused on the technical nitty-gritty behind what automation software is actually _doing_. But we haven’t discussed the elephant in the room yet. What happens to the reps and SDRs who all of a sudden find they’ve got nothing left to do because it’s all been automated?\n\n  \n\nWell, that’s not quite the case. Sure, sales team members won’t be as busy with time-consuming, manual tasks like lead scoring or churning out follow-up emails. Instead, they’ll be devoting their energy towards high-value sales engagement activities that only they can perform.\n\n  \n\nThe actual art of selling – the cold calling, the back-and-forth, the push-and-pull, the cat and the proverbial mouse – is all still firmly the domain of humans. And because they don’t need to waste time on manual busywork, reps and SDRs will be able to hyper-focus their sales efforts on the tasks that ultimately bring in revenue for their organization. \n\n  \n\nThere’s still a place for traditional sales reps, sales managers, and SDRs. But their role is going to look drastically different from how it used to – more productive, more challenging, and ultimately more rewarding.  \n  \nAnd for companies, the potential for improvement is just as significant. Every manager has wished they could make a dozen copies of their best-performing rep and populate the entire team with them. Well, that’s pretty much possible now, with the ability to replicate the strategies of top-performing salespeople, streamline them, and circulate them across the entire team. By making the most of an automation platform, every BDR can be turned into a top-performing sales rep, radically increasing productivity and efficiency across the board.\n\n  \n\n### Sales Engagement Strategies\n\nAccording to a [2023 study](https://belkins.io/blog/cold-email-response-rates#:~:text=The%20average%20cold%20email%20response,from%206.1%25%20to%202.5%25.)\n carried out by Belkins, cold email reply rates range from as low as 2% in some major industries to as high as 10% in others. Which is less than ideal, given that the ROI for emails can be as [high as 45x](https://www.litmus.com/blog/infographic-the-roi-of-email-marketing)\n. So increasing response rates should obviously be a matter of high priority for any team looking to optimize its sales funnel, schedule more meetings and fill up its pipeline with high-quality potential deals.\n\n  \n![ROI by Industry](https://www.artisan.co/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.ctfassets.net%2Fkyprwggh4muz%2F57P65iiK4Iya3W5a1EL3Cc%2F6500c670082c618fb9219cd78e2c5a20%2FScreenshot_2024-06-28_at_4.26.50_PM.png&w=3840&q=75)\n\n_From Litmus' ROI of Email Marketing Infographic_\n\n  \n\nFortunately, automation can help out here as well. Machine-learning powered outbound sales technology makes personalized outreach possible at a scale humans simply can’t compete with, allowing forward-thinking sales teams to ramp up their volume without needing to sacrifice the individual touch that can often make all the difference.\n\n  \n\nIn a similar vein, consistency, frequency and optimal timing are all elements of the outreach process that can be automated with ease. The potential for ultra-precise segmentation gives every single email the best chance of reaching its ideal customer, while detailed analytics and comprehensive A/B testing functionality makes it possible to improve the overall process in real-time.\n\n  \n\nLeveraging Technology for Sales Success\n---------------------------------------\n\n![Lead Generation + Management](https://www.artisan.co/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.ctfassets.net%2Fkyprwggh4muz%2F3h1R5TefyohGqDH3Zha6bg%2Fed3ba44a36a22248a6a4c9cfbf4404fc%2F2__Lead_Generation___Managemetn.webp&w=3840&q=75)\n\n### AI-Powered Automation\n\nWe’ve already discussed how that outbound sales automation technology is capable of personalizing sales outreach communication at scale. But we haven’t actually discussed what that looks like in practice – and what better real-world example than Artisan’s very own [AI BDR, Ava](https://www.artisan.co/ai-sales-agent)\n?\n\n  \n\nAva’s capable of scraping prospects’ social media posts in order to update her customer profiles with the most recent personal data. For instance, imagine you’re a B2B SaaS company selling HR payroll software. Your ideal customers, in this example, are startups that have just raised funding. Ava, thanks to her Crunchbase integration, will automatically be able to identify startups that have recently raised rounds, enroll them in a workflow, and be the first one in their email inbox with a hyper-personalized message.\n\n  \n\nNow picture that same process happening constantly, across every single prospect you’re working with, without your reps needing to lift a finger. If that’s not a game-changer, we don’t know what is.\n\n  \n\nThe real beauty of AI-powered automation lies in its ability to continuously learn and improve. Predictive analytics, powered by the constant stream of data the software is taking in, makes it possible to discover trends, make informed predictions about future performance and tweak your current strategy for the highest probability of success. And because it’s all powered by AI, the entire process can happen at as large a scale as you need it to.\n\n  \n\n### Integrations and Functionalities\n\nThe modern business world is hyper-connected, so it only stands to reason that sales software should be as well. And as any SDR will be able to tell you, the sheer amount of business tools available these days is nothing short of staggering. Email marketing software, CRMs, data integration suites, analytics programs – the list goes on.\n\n  \n\nWith such a smorgasbord of tools being used on a daily basis, it’s vitally important that outbound sales automation software can integrate with all of them. Switching seamlessly from prospecting software to updating your CRM of choice, drawing on analytics reports to inform cold email outreach: it all works together, and it all _just works_.\n\n  \n\nBut none of that means you should need to completely redesign your existing strategies in order to implement automation technology. The best software will automatically hook into your existing CRM, automatically trawling through your existing insights and re-engaging qualified leads that have gone cold. Next, it’ll update your CRM with ultra-precise, bang up-to-date details like method of engagement, behavior data points, additional insights, and so on.  \n  \nAll of this helps optimize your process and increase your results, and it all happens on auto-pilot, freeing up dozens of hours of manual work that can be redirected towards actively selling instead.\n\n  \n\n**Ready to step into the future of outbound?** [Check out how Ava automates 80% of your outbound cycle.](https://www.artisan.co/ai-sales-agent)\n\n  \n\nMeasuring and Improving Sales Performance\n-----------------------------------------\n\n![Analytics](https://www.artisan.co/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.ctfassets.net%2Fkyprwggh4muz%2F4FEAIRfS7VQpzHLNFAF15m%2Ff5124fa67eb742adb75a5f4f1140c2db%2FScreenshot_2024-06-28_at_5.19.47_PM.png&w=3840&q=75)\n\n### Key Metrics and KPIs\n\nOne of the biggest advantages provided by sales automation tools is their ability to process huge amounts of data.\n\n  \n\n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Conversion Rates.** By analyzing conversion rates at scale across your entire funnel, automation can help identify speed bumps and suggest strategies for fixing the problem, saving you dozens of hours of manual analysis in the process.\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Sales Cycle Time.** Automation can spot the points in the sales cycle that accelerate it the most and help you prioritize them in your process. \n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Lead-to-Close Ratios.** When you use automation to analyze your lead-to-close ratios, you get far deeper insights into areas for optimization thanks to the sheer depth and breadth of the data being mined.\n    \n      \n    \n\n### Continuous Optimization\n\nNot unlike those sharks who never stop moving, if a sales team stops optimizing its process, it’ll fall behind its competitors. Thankfully, outbound sales automation software allows you to improve as you go across the board.  \n  \nWith automation, software will be able to automatically set different campaigns, run tests, and implement improvements based on KPIs and ideal results. We’re essentially entering a new paradigm of continuous and automatic optimization, where sales reps don’t have to manually set and adjust campaigns anymore, and where every major decision throughout the outbound sales process is made based on huge treasure troves of cold, hard data.\n\n  \n\nA Look Ahead to Emerging Tools and Technologies\n-----------------------------------------------\n\n![Ava ](https://www.artisan.co/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.ctfassets.net%2Fkyprwggh4muz%2F1F1K07Hn1H4RBzoqR7Rips%2F290b810b3dfd3f3c30c2529376c62765%2F5__ending.webp&w=3840&q=75)\n\n### AI and Machine Learning\n\nAI and Machine Learning is poised to radically disrupt the current sales landscape – the advantages offered by automation are just too much of a game-changer to ignore. For example, take [Ava, Artisan’s AI BDR](https://www.artisan.co/ai-sales-agent)\n. She’ll be able to automate 80% of a human BDR’s workflow, make her own autonomous decisions, brief you on upcoming meetings, reach out to new prospects, and keep everything meticulously updated in her CRM. By using cutting-edge technology to analyze, implement, and continuously optimize at scale, forward-looking organizations will find themselves at a distinct advantage over any of their competitors who haven’t yet integrated automation into their processes.\n\n  \n\n### Enhanced CRM Capabilities\n\nAs AI continues to improve day-by-day, CRMs are becoming more powerful than ever. Some of the most exciting features include natural language processing, sentiment analysis, real-time decision-making, and even truly sci-fi concepts like recognizing faces or voices via biometric analysis. For a sales rep using the CRM of tomorrow, the workflow is going to be almost unrecognizable. Instead of manually entering lead data and moving the process along by hand, they might simply talk to their software instead, asking for specific insights, the latest updates on their deals, or guidance as to what they should focus on next.  \n  \nThe CRM will be able to suggest the best way for the rep to spend their time based on the current state of the pipeline. Maybe it’s the perfect moment to reach out to that prospect from a couple weeks ago, because sentiment analysis of a recent Tweet has revealed they’re particularly unhappy with their current solution. Or maybe it’s time to strike while the iron is hot on a few new leads, because past insights on leads in a similar industry indicates they respond best to a quick invitation to a product demo. \n\n  \n\nThe possibilities are endless; the potential, staggering. To sum it all up in plain English, it’s an exciting time to be in sales – and the future’s only getting brighter.\n\n  \n\n**Experience cutting-edge sales automation firsthand.** [Hire Ava](https://www.artisan.co/ai-sales-agent)\n and she’ll immediately launch a lead generation campaign just for you, focusing all her efforts on high-quality leads and quick results.\n\n  \n\n  \n\nShare Article\n\n![copy-link](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/copy-link.svg)[![copy-link](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/mail.svg)](mailto:?body=https://www.artisan.co/blog/outbound-sales-automation)\n\nYou might also like\n-------------------\n\nReady to Supercharge Your Outbound?\n-----------------------------------\n\nOur AI-first platform equips your team with best-in-class outbound tools and our AI BDR Ava, who automates your entire outbound workflow.\n\nPhone\n\nGet Started\n\n### Products\n\n*   [Artisan Sales Overview](/sales-ai)\n    \n*   [Ava, the AI Sales Agent](/ai-sales-agent)\n    \n*   [B2B Data](/products/b2b-data)\n    \n*   [Sales Playbooks](/products/sales-playbooks)\n    \n*   [Email Warmup](/products/email-warmup)\n    \n*   [Sales Automation](/products/sales-automation)\n    \n\n### Resources\n\n*   [Blog](/blog)\n    \n*   [Demos](/watch-demo)\n    \n*   [Support](https://support.artisan.co/)\n    \n*   [Case Studies](/casestudies)\n    \n*   ChangelogSoon\n    \n\n### Solutions\n\n*   [Enterprise](/solutions/enterprise)\n    \n*   [Midmarket](/solutions/midmarket)\n    \n*   [Startups](/solutions/startups)\n    \n*   Lead Gen AgenciesSoon\n    \n\n### Company\n\n*   [About Us](/about)\n    \n*   [Contact Us](/contact-us)\n    \n*   [Careers](/careers)\n    \n*   Artisan LabsSoon\n    \n\n![artisan-logo](https://www.artisan.co/_next/image?url=%2Fassets%2Flogo.webp&w=384&q=75)\n\n© 2024 Artisan AI Inc.

Language separates us from our primate cousins. As noted by Mark Pagel in a recent [BMC Biology paper](https://bmcbiol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12915-017-0405-3#citeas)\n, “It is unlikely that any other species, including our close genetic cousins the Neanderthals, ever had language.” However, language alone isn’t our only differentiator as a species. Humans also possess the “[urge to connect](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/2-mental-abilities-separate-humans-from-animals/)\n.” That is, the drive to exchange thoughts and ideas with others.\n\n  \n\nThese two traits have created language that is both versatile and valuable, but eternally vexing to engineers and developers looking to bridge the gap between technology and the human condition.\n\n  \n\nArtificial intelligence (AI) is one recent effort to imbue programs with human-like qualities. It’s a long road to artificial general intelligence, or general AI, which could mimic humans’ general cognitive abilities. However, we are making inroads with specific AI use cases that could change how we interact with the world and with each other.\n\n  \n\nAI language models, also called large language models (LLMs) are one area of AI undergoing rapid evolution. In this piece, we’ll explore the unique properties of human language, the barriers to effective AI understanding, and how evolving LLMs may pave the way for a new kind of conversation.\n\n  \n\n**AI Language Models: From Primates to Programs**\n-------------------------------------------------\n\nStudies have shown that primates can recognize and respond to specific language cues — one gorilla even had a “vocabulary” of [over 2,000 words](https://www.nationalgeographic.com/animals/article/gorillas-koko-sign-language-culture-animals)\n! Programs are also capable of parsing language. For example, first-generation chatbots could pick out key words and phrases to help users find specific content or refer them to support.\n\n  \n\nHumans, however, go beyond these basics thanks to a key concept: context.\n\n  \n\nConsider a conversation between two friends. The first asks how the second is doing, and the second replies “fine”. The word is easy to parse: [Merriam-Webster](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/fine)\n defines it as “well or healthy; not sick or injured.” Despite the obvious meaning, however, the first friend replies “I’m here if you need to talk.”\n\n  \n\nWhat happened? Put simply, the first friend both heard the word and saw the connecting context. Common contextual considerations include tone of voice, facial expressions, volume, and body language. By aggregating this data, humans are capable of understanding both the surface and subtextual meanings of language. This isn’t to say we’re perfect — our lives are full of misread situations and misunderstandings because context wasn’t clear. However, while it may not always be 100% accurate, the ability to capture context is why even the smartest primates can’t quite reach human intelligence levels.\n\n  \n\nIt is also why language analysis technologies have historically struggled to move beyond basic questions-and-answers. However, AI language models have made remarkable advances in recent years.\n\n  \n\n**Can AI Language Models Break Barriers?**\n------------------------------------------\n\nAlong with context, human language is also unique because it’s compositional. This property allows humans to express their thoughts in sentences that recognize multiple tenses and use a combination of subjects, objects, and verbs. With just 25 subjects, 25 objects, and 25 verbs, it’s possible to create [more than 15,000 sentences](https://bmcbiol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12915-017-0405-3#)\n.\n\n  \n\nThe compositional nature of human language also makes it possible to create strings of seemingly nonsense words that actually make sense in context. Consider the (in)famous buffalo sentence below:\n\n  \n\n_Buffalo buffalo Buffalo buffalo buffalo buffalo Buffalo buffalo._\n\n  \n\nWhile this looks like gibberish, it’s grammatically correct. It lacks punctuation and articles such as “which” or “that”, but it is possible to understand. Here’s how.\n\n  \n\nThe three blue Buffalos represent the city of Buffalo.\n\n  \n\nThe three pink buffalo refer to groups of the animal, while the two green buffalo represent the verb buffalo, which means to intimidate or confuse. Putting that all together, the meaning of the sentence becomes:\n\n  \n\n_A group of buffalo, from Buffalo, that are intimidated by a group of buffalo from Buffalo, also intimate a group of buffalo from Buffalo._\n\n  \n\nSure, it’s not an easy read, but with the ability to parse compositional language, it does make sense. While most human sentences aren’t quite so convoluted, we naturally assume that listeners have the ability to combine the obvious meaning of our words with both contextual and compositional clues.\n\n  \n\nThe result is what we’ve seen for years around the development of AI language models: they do well when sentences are simple and straightforward, but struggle when meanings aren’t clear.\n\n  \n\nEmerging AI language models, however, are changing the game.\n\n  \n\n### The Basics of LLMs\n\nAI language models aren’t new. As artificial intelligence moved from potential to possible, researchers quickly realized the potential of AI to analyze and understand language. Historically, however, language models were limited in scope and size.\n\n  \n\nIn addition, these models assigned equal weight to each word in a sentence, meaning they weren’t able to parse any meaning beyond the obvious. This made them ideal for simple, self-service tasks. Take first-generation chatbots. They could point users in the direction of specific resources or connect them to customer service agents, but lacked the ability to dive any deeper.\n\n  \n\nWhat’s the difference between AI language models and chatbots? The former are far more advanced.\n\n  \n\nLarge language models change the game. These models utilize deep learning architectures called transformer networks and models. Models are neural networks that learn how to read context and meaning in sequential data, including data found in human language.\n\n  \n\nUnlike their smaller-scale progenitors, large-scale models have access to much larger datasets. These datasets allow LLMs to provide more accurate and more contextually-relevant answers thanks to two key transformer network innovations: positional encoding and self-attention.\n\n  \n\nPositional encoding makes it possible for language models to analyze input data in any order, rather than relying on the sequential input of words. Self-attention, meanwhile, makes it possible for models to assign different weights to different parts of a sentence based on both the current data input and the analysis of all previous language inputs.\n\n  \n\nTogether, positional encoding and self-attention make it possible for LLMs to quickly process large volumes of data and produce more accurate query results.\n\n  \n\n### Artificial Intelligence, Real Impact: Large Language Models in Action\n\nIt’s one thing to design a language model capable of improving over time to better understand humans and provide relevant responses, but what does this look like in practice?\n\n  \n\nHere are five examples of language learning models in action.\n\n  \n\n#### Search Results\n\nSearch engines such as Google and Bing are already using LLMs to improve search results. By applying large language models to understand the context of user queries, search engines can provide more accurate, relevant hits.\n\n  \n\n#### Content Generation\n\nTools like ChatGPT and Dall-E are now using AI language models to generate new content based on user criteria. For example, staff might ask ChatGPT to provide subject lines for marketing emails, or offer ideas for a new blog post. Dall-E, meanwhile, can create AI-generated art in the style of one (or many) historic artists.\n\n  \n\n#### Customer Service\n\nFrom a customer service standpoint, chatbots are the most common application of large language models. With access to large enough datasets — both internally and externally — chatbots and digital workers are now capable of understanding user intention and basic emotion to provide improved customer service.\n\n  \n\nConsider a frustrated customer connected with a service chatbot. Based on the type of language used and the way sentences are constructed, the chatbot can recognize the need for speedy resolution and connect the customer with the ideal service agent. [Artisan AI Sales Reps](/ai-sales-agent)\n go even deeper. These digital employees act very much like a human worker and can respond to user inquiries, communicate with your team, and much more.\n\n  \n\n#### Language Translation\n\nLLMs are also being used in language translation. Given their ability to pull meaning and context from user-generated input, AI-driven models are ideally suited to ensuring translations aren’t simply direct transformations of words and phrases. Instead, LLMs accurately identify and carry over the subtleties and meaning from input language to output content.\n\n  \n\n#### Document Analysis\n\nFor industries such as finance, law, and healthcare, LLMs can be used to identify key themes, pinpoint repeated themes or ideas, or discover issues with reporting and documentation that must be addressed before reports are filed or businesses take action.\n\n  \n\n**What’s Next?**\n----------------\n\nThe nature of AI language models means they’re always improving. More data means more context, and a greater ability to deliver accurate results.\n\n  \n\nBut what comes next? As noted by [Forbes](https://www.forbes.com/sites/robtoews/2023/02/07/the-next-generation-of-large-language-models/?sh=16623cef18db)\n, one significant change already underway is the explosive growth of generative AI tools, such as ChatGPT. This natural language processing tool (NLP) makes it possible for humans to have human-like conversations with AI. Initially, these tools learned using collected data from all previous queries. Newer versions of ChatGPT are capable of searching the Internet at large for data to create effective replies.\n\n  \n\nDespite advancements, however, AI tools are not yet perfect. While they can produce human-like responses, these responses may not be accurate. This is because they’re designed to generate answers that are plausible and easy to parse — but aren’t necessarily factual. This creates another opportunity for AI growth: knowledge retrieval. Here, LLMs are provided with access to external knowledge sources and use these sources to ensure answers are factual and accurate in addition to being easy on the eyes.\n\n  \n\nThere’s also a growing demand for digital workers capable of automating tasks in a specific role. For example, digital workers might act as sales representatives, marketers, designers, or recruiters. Using advanced AI, these workers are capable of carrying out all the tasks associated with their role, and can also interact directly with human workers. In effect, they act as full-fledged members of business teams, albeit with lower costs and improved performance.\n\n  \n\nThis includes [Artisan AI’s sales rep, Ava](/ai-sales-agent)\n. Ava is a fully automated outbound sales rep capable of doing everything from booking meetings to sending emails to responding to customer inquiries. Also, much like a real worker, Ava learns over time. Her built-in cutting-edge analytics help her self-improve and optimize her performance.\n\n  \n\nIt’s also worth noting that as AI language models evolve, so too will the role of human workers. While there’s a growing fear of AI replacing human staff, the far more likely scenario is that roles will simply shift. While AI might handle the heavy lifting of drafting a marketing email or creating a web design, humans in the loop remain essential to review and revise ideas before they go live.\n\n  \n\n**The Bottom Line: AI Language Models and Language 2.0**\n--------------------------------------------------------\n\nWhile AI will never be quite “human”, it’s inching closer and closer to the mark. AI language models are a key step in this progression — the ability to understand content and context and improve this understanding over time sets the stage for new iterations of AI capable of answering more questions, delivering more accurate results, and streamlining key business processes.\n\n  \n\nShare Article\n\n![copy-link](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/copy-link.svg)[![copy-link](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/mail.svg)](mailto:?body=https://www.artisan.co/blog/ai-language-models-2024)\n\nYou might also like\n-------------------\n\nReady to Supercharge Your Outbound?\n-----------------------------------\n\nOur AI-first platform equips your team with best-in-class outbound tools and our AI BDR Ava, who automates your entire outbound workflow.\n\nPhone\n\nGet Started\n\n### Products\n\n*   [Artisan Sales Overview](/sales-ai)\n    \n*   [Ava, the AI Sales Agent](/ai-sales-agent)\n    \n*   [B2B Data](/products/b2b-data)\n    \n*   [Sales Playbooks](/products/sales-playbooks)\n    \n*   [Email Warmup](/products/email-warmup)\n    \n*   [Sales Automation](/products/sales-automation)\n    \n\n### Resources\n\n*   [Blog](/blog)\n    \n*   [Demos](/watch-demo)\n    \n*   [Support](https://support.artisan.co/)\n    \n*   [Case Studies](/casestudies)\n    \n*   ChangelogSoon\n    \n\n### Solutions\n\n*   [Enterprise](/solutions/enterprise)\n    \n*   [Midmarket](/solutions/midmarket)\n    \n*   [Startups](/solutions/startups)\n    \n*   Lead Gen AgenciesSoon\n    \n\n### Company\n\n*   [About Us](/about)\n    \n*   [Contact Us](/contact-us)\n    \n*   [Careers](/careers)\n    \n*   Artisan LabsSoon\n    \n\n![artisan-logo](https://www.artisan.co/_next/image?url=%2Fassets%2Flogo.webp&w=384&q=75)\n\n© 2024 Artisan AI Inc.

Language separates us from our primate cousins. As noted by Mark Pagel in a recent [BMC Biology paper](https://bmcbiol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12915-017-0405-3#citeas)\n, “It is unlikely that any other species, including our close genetic cousins the Neanderthals, ever had language.” However, language alone isn’t our only differentiator as a species. Humans also possess the “[urge to connect](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/2-mental-abilities-separate-humans-from-animals/)\n.” That is, the drive to exchange thoughts and ideas with others.\n\n  \n\nThese two traits have created language that is both versatile and valuable, but eternally vexing to engineers and developers looking to bridge the gap between technology and the human condition.\n\n  \n\nArtificial intelligence (AI) is one recent effort to imbue programs with human-like qualities. It’s a long road to artificial general intelligence, or general AI, which could mimic humans’ general cognitive abilities. However, we are making inroads with specific AI use cases that could change how we interact with the world and with each other.\n\n  \n\nAI language models, also called large language models (LLMs) are one area of AI undergoing rapid evolution. In this piece, we’ll explore the unique properties of human language, the barriers to effective AI understanding, and how evolving LLMs may pave the way for a new kind of conversation.\n\n  \n\n**AI Language Models: From Primates to Programs**\n-------------------------------------------------\n\nStudies have shown that primates can recognize and respond to specific language cues — one gorilla even had a “vocabulary” of [over 2,000 words](https://www.nationalgeographic.com/animals/article/gorillas-koko-sign-language-culture-animals)\n! Programs are also capable of parsing language. For example, first-generation chatbots could pick out key words and phrases to help users find specific content or refer them to support.\n\n  \n\nHumans, however, go beyond these basics thanks to a key concept: context.\n\n  \n\nConsider a conversation between two friends. The first asks how the second is doing, and the second replies “fine”. The word is easy to parse: [Merriam-Webster](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/fine)\n defines it as “well or healthy; not sick or injured.” Despite the obvious meaning, however, the first friend replies “I’m here if you need to talk.”\n\n  \n\nWhat happened? Put simply, the first friend both heard the word and saw the connecting context. Common contextual considerations include tone of voice, facial expressions, volume, and body language. By aggregating this data, humans are capable of understanding both the surface and subtextual meanings of language. This isn’t to say we’re perfect — our lives are full of misread situations and misunderstandings because context wasn’t clear. However, while it may not always be 100% accurate, the ability to capture context is why even the smartest primates can’t quite reach human intelligence levels.\n\n  \n\nIt is also why language analysis technologies have historically struggled to move beyond basic questions-and-answers. However, AI language models have made remarkable advances in recent years.\n\n  \n\n**Can AI Language Models Break Barriers?**\n------------------------------------------\n\nAlong with context, human language is also unique because it’s compositional. This property allows humans to express their thoughts in sentences that recognize multiple tenses and use a combination of subjects, objects, and verbs. With just 25 subjects, 25 objects, and 25 verbs, it’s possible to create [more than 15,000 sentences](https://bmcbiol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12915-017-0405-3#)\n.\n\n  \n\nThe compositional nature of human language also makes it possible to create strings of seemingly nonsense words that actually make sense in context. Consider the (in)famous buffalo sentence below:\n\n  \n\n_Buffalo buffalo Buffalo buffalo buffalo buffalo Buffalo buffalo._\n\n  \n\nWhile this looks like gibberish, it’s grammatically correct. It lacks punctuation and articles such as “which” or “that”, but it is possible to understand. Here’s how.\n\n  \n\nThe three blue Buffalos represent the city of Buffalo.\n\n  \n\nThe three pink buffalo refer to groups of the animal, while the two green buffalo represent the verb buffalo, which means to intimidate or confuse. Putting that all together, the meaning of the sentence becomes:\n\n  \n\n_A group of buffalo, from Buffalo, that are intimidated by a group of buffalo from Buffalo, also intimate a group of buffalo from Buffalo._\n\n  \n\nSure, it’s not an easy read, but with the ability to parse compositional language, it does make sense. While most human sentences aren’t quite so convoluted, we naturally assume that listeners have the ability to combine the obvious meaning of our words with both contextual and compositional clues.\n\n  \n\nThe result is what we’ve seen for years around the development of AI language models: they do well when sentences are simple and straightforward, but struggle when meanings aren’t clear.\n\n  \n\nEmerging AI language models, however, are changing the game.\n\n  \n\n### The Basics of LLMs\n\nAI language models aren’t new. As artificial intelligence moved from potential to possible, researchers quickly realized the potential of AI to analyze and understand language. Historically, however, language models were limited in scope and size.\n\n  \n\nIn addition, these models assigned equal weight to each word in a sentence, meaning they weren’t able to parse any meaning beyond the obvious. This made them ideal for simple, self-service tasks. Take first-generation chatbots. They could point users in the direction of specific resources or connect them to customer service agents, but lacked the ability to dive any deeper.\n\n  \n\nWhat’s the difference between AI language models and chatbots? The former are far more advanced.\n\n  \n\nLarge language models change the game. These models utilize deep learning architectures called transformer networks and models. Models are neural networks that learn how to read context and meaning in sequential data, including data found in human language.\n\n  \n\nUnlike their smaller-scale progenitors, large-scale models have access to much larger datasets. These datasets allow LLMs to provide more accurate and more contextually-relevant answers thanks to two key transformer network innovations: positional encoding and self-attention.\n\n  \n\nPositional encoding makes it possible for language models to analyze input data in any order, rather than relying on the sequential input of words. Self-attention, meanwhile, makes it possible for models to assign different weights to different parts of a sentence based on both the current data input and the analysis of all previous language inputs.\n\n  \n\nTogether, positional encoding and self-attention make it possible for LLMs to quickly process large volumes of data and produce more accurate query results.\n\n  \n\n### Artificial Intelligence, Real Impact: Large Language Models in Action\n\nIt’s one thing to design a language model capable of improving over time to better understand humans and provide relevant responses, but what does this look like in practice?\n\n  \n\nHere are five examples of language learning models in action.\n\n  \n\n#### Search Results\n\nSearch engines such as Google and Bing are already using LLMs to improve search results. By applying large language models to understand the context of user queries, search engines can provide more accurate, relevant hits.\n\n  \n\n#### Content Generation\n\nTools like ChatGPT and Dall-E are now using AI language models to generate new content based on user criteria. For example, staff might ask ChatGPT to provide subject lines for marketing emails, or offer ideas for a new blog post. Dall-E, meanwhile, can create AI-generated art in the style of one (or many) historic artists.\n\n  \n\n#### Customer Service\n\nFrom a customer service standpoint, chatbots are the most common application of large language models. With access to large enough datasets — both internally and externally — chatbots and digital workers are now capable of understanding user intention and basic emotion to provide improved customer service.\n\n  \n\nConsider a frustrated customer connected with a service chatbot. Based on the type of language used and the way sentences are constructed, the chatbot can recognize the need for speedy resolution and connect the customer with the ideal service agent. [Artisan AI Sales Reps](/ai-sales-agent)\n go even deeper. These digital employees act very much like a human worker and can respond to user inquiries, communicate with your team, and much more.\n\n  \n\n#### Language Translation\n\nLLMs are also being used in language translation. Given their ability to pull meaning and context from user-generated input, AI-driven models are ideally suited to ensuring translations aren’t simply direct transformations of words and phrases. Instead, LLMs accurately identify and carry over the subtleties and meaning from input language to output content.\n\n  \n\n#### Document Analysis\n\nFor industries such as finance, law, and healthcare, LLMs can be used to identify key themes, pinpoint repeated themes or ideas, or discover issues with reporting and documentation that must be addressed before reports are filed or businesses take action.\n\n  \n\n**What’s Next?**\n----------------\n\nThe nature of AI language models means they’re always improving. More data means more context, and a greater ability to deliver accurate results.\n\n  \n\nBut what comes next?

With content marketing, social media marketing, blogging, and video dominating, you might think old-school outbound techniques are obsolete by now.\n\n  \n\nBut don’t be fooled – outbound is still going strong.\n\n  \n\nIn fact, [75% of executives](https://spotio.com/blog/sales-statistics/#outboundsales)\n state that they’d be willing to make an appointment or attend an event based on a single cold call or email, showcasing just how effective outbound can be.\n\n  \n\n_If conducted properly,_ that is.\n\n  \n\nBut enough about other companies – let’s talk about your business. How are your outbound efforts stacking up? Are you seeing the results you want? If not, you’ve come to the right place for a tune-up.\n\n  \n\nToday, we’ll explore how outbound creates opportunities instead of just waiting for inbound leads. I’ll share not only how to make outbound work for you but how to master the entire process from A to Z.\n\n  \n\nSo, buckle up and get ready to become an outbound sales pro. With the right strategy and execution, you can transform outbound from outdated to cutting-edge. Let’s stop wondering and start dominating!\n\n  \n\n**An Introduction to Outbound Sales**\n-------------------------------------\n\n![21](https://www.artisan.co/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.ctfassets.net%2Fkyprwggh4muz%2F4YUhg6rjsxZgr6LQxqCtyZ%2F8f8a6dfb707521da91b6aa3a39be877a%2F21.jpeg&w=3840&q=75)\n\nOutbound sales are the opposite of the “build it, and they will come” mindset.\n\n  \n\nInstead, you’re putting on those walking shoes, grabbing your Rolodex, and hitting the pavement to hunt down leads that are best suited for your business.\n\n  \n\nWhile both inbound and outbound sales aim to bring in customers and make sales, outbound sales offer a unique advantage compared with the inbound process.\n\n  \n\nOne word: **control**.\n\n  \n\nWith outbound sales, you steer the ship and chart your own course. Instead of passively relying on leads finding you, you actively seek them out on your terms. And the more time and resources you dedicate, the more prospects you’ll uncover.\n\n  \n\nWhat’s more, outbound gives you total control to build your pipeline precisely how you want, focusing on the targets and leads you to deem most promising.\n\n  \n\nNo more waiting and hoping – just good old-fashioned hustle.\n\n  \n\nThese are just a handful of the many advantages outbound sales offers. If you want to grab the reins and take charge of your pipeline, outbound is the way to go!\n\n  \n\n### **What’s the Difference Between Outbound and Inbound Sales?**\n\nWith inbound sales, you take a more passive approach. Like casting a wide net and seeing what fish swim into it, you create content, optimize for search, and run campaigns hoping to attract leads.\n\n  \n\nIf someone reaches out (or you hook them) after seeing your stuff, that’s inbound working its magic!\n\n  \n\nOutbound sales are the opposite – think door-to-door salesperson vs. bait shop owner.\n\n  \n\nInstead of waiting around, you grab your tackle box and actively head out into the world to hunt for leads. This requires research to find potential customers, crafting personalized messages, and reaching out through email, social media, calls, etc.\n\n  \n\nWhile inbound and outbound sales effectively have a similar goal, inbound marketing is sitting back with a Mai Tai, hoping the fish bite. Outbound is putting on waders, grabbing a net, and scooping up fish whether they’re biting or not.\n\n  \n\nRemember, there is no inbound vs outbound sales war. Both are valid strategies with pros and cons! One is reactive, one proactive. Choose the approach that fits your sales style and business goals.\n\n  \n\n### **The Problem With Modern Outbound Sales**\n\nLet’s address the elephant in the room – many businesses are struggling with outbound sales.\n\n  \n\nAccording to [a 2022 Hubspot report](https://www.hubspot.com/marketing-statistics?)\n, only 16% of marketers say outbound practices lead to quality leads. Ineffective outbound sales strategies prove this, with [over half of outbound marketers](https://www.zendesk.co.uk/blog/sales-statistics/)\n admitting their approaches just aren’t working.\n\n  \n\nThere are plenty of fingers pointing at issues like:\n\n  \n\n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    Poor communication between teams\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    Not having enough info to properly engage prospects\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    Skyrocketing customer expectations\n    \n      \n    \n\n  \nThe bottom line? Despite time and money invested in outbound, results are stagnant, draining, and unproductive.\n\n  \n\nHowever, the problem is not that outbound sales are inherently bad practice so much as a lack of clear strategy.\n\n  \n\nThe core issue is simple: many companies see outbound as a numbers game focused on quantity over quality. But genuine connection is so critical!\n\n  \n\nThink about how often you open your inbox to find it crammed with messages from companies you don’t care about. Annoying, right?\n\n  \n\nBusinesses are churning out content and outreach, but it falls flat because it’s so impersonal. And with more subpar digital tools automating everything, sales teams blast generic pitches to thousands with little success.\n\n  \n\nThe result? Prospects feel overwhelmed by impersonal outreach, so response rates drop, giving outbound a bad reputation.\n\n  \n\nFor outbound to really soar, your outbound sales approach needs an overhaul.\n\n  \n\n**The Benefits of an Effective Outbound Sales Strategy**\n--------------------------------------------------------\n\nExecuted correctly, outbound sales are one of the most powerful strategies for keeping your pipeline full and closing deals. They let you directly contact potential customers and have meaningful conversations.\n\n  \n\nEffective outbound also enables you to:\n\n  \n\n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    Build relationships with prospects before they even realize they need you\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    Control the narrative and spotlight your unique value proposition\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    Stand out from competitors by offering personalized solutions for pain points\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    Save time and resources by targeting only qualified, bullseye outbound leads\n    \n      \n    \n\n  \nWhen done right, outbound lets you engage leads on your terms and steer them through the buyer’s journey. It’s like having a blueprint to build strong relationships and promote your solutions.\n\n  \n\nOutbound sales can be effective when done right, and statistics back this up. Companies that don’t cold call [experience 42% less growth](https://about.crunchbase.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Cold_Calling_Tips_Sale_Reps-V4.pdf?hubs_content=blog.hubspot.com%252Fsales%252Fsales-statistics&hubs_content-cta=Sales%2520Prospecting%2520Statistics)\n than those who do. [71% of buyers](https://www.rainsalestraining.com/blog/b2b-sales-funnel-stages)\n are open to talking to sellers when they’re actively looking for new solutions.\n\n  \n\nA stellar outbound sales strategy executed flawlessly can be an absolute game-changer for driving deals. Turn cold calling into warm conversations, and watch your pipeline heat up!\n\n  \n\n**What Does a Successful Outbound Sales Process Look Like? Six Key Steps**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n![22](https://www.artisan.co/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.ctfassets.net%2Fkyprwggh4muz%2F3RstkYKb1ZTseCbHaHhEVH%2F2033fb8f72b8a9d391e2a73cafdad937%2F22.png&w=3840&q=75)\n\nWhile the approach varies from business to business, a generally successful outbound sales process will look like this:\n\n  \n\n### **Step #1 – Research and Identify Your Target Audience**\n\nBefore reaching out, it’s crucial to fully understand your ideal customer. Effective selling means grasping their desires and needs. The more intel you gather, the better you can customize your outreach.\n\n  \n\nThis approach hugely benefits your sales reps, especially when dealing with diverse clients or a wide range of products/services.\n\n  \n\nUtilize data-driven research tools to pinpoint companies or people matching your target audience profile.\n\n  \n\nMarket segmentation is key here, and you’ll need to ask critical questions like:\n\n  \n\n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    Who is your target audience?\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    What types of businesses are you aiming to sell to?\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    Who are the decision-makers in these companies?\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    Have you built a detailed buyer persona?\n    \n      \n    \n\n  \nWithout comprehensive answers, your team may lack the vital details to connect with the right folks. In fact, [42% of sales reps](https://spotio.com/blog/sales-statistics/)\n feel they don’t have enough information about prospects prior to making calls.\n\n  \n\nDo your homework and get crystal clear on your ideal customer. This level of insight takes your outbound efforts from generic to tailored, and you’ll know exactly how to resonate with each prospect and guide them to your solutions.\n\n  \n\nThis is highly targeted outreach at its finest.\n\n  \n\nTools like [Artisan AI’s Sales Reps](/ai-sales-agent)\n can help speed up this process. Ava, Artisan’s AI sales rep, comes with over 265 million built-in leads to help you create a targeted list of potential contacts.\n\n  \n\n### **Step #2 – Creating a Lead Database**\n\nAlright, you’ve identified your dream customers. Now it’s time to gather their deets to connect with them. The best way is an organized lead database.\n\n  \n\nWe know, databases sound boring. But having all your prospects in one searchable place is crucial for your sales reps. They’ll have everything needed to target the right folks and crush it.\n\n  \n\nWe’re talking essential info like:\n\n  \n\n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    Email addresses\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    Phone numbers\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    Social media profiles (primarily LinkedIn)\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    Company name and website\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    Job title and department\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    Pain points they may have\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    Other useful personal details (birthdays, preferences, etc)\n    \n      \n    \n\n  \nAnd here’s a pro tip – treat your database like a garden, not a chore. Nurture it! Add new leads, update info, and weed out outdated contacts. This keeps your prospect list fresh and fertile for sales success.\n\n  \n\nHaving this organized and up-to-date resource makes targeting and outreach way easier. You can filter leads by location, company, role, and more to create perfect outreach lists.\n\n  \n\nSo embrace the database! It may not be sexy, but it’ll help you get results and forge great relationships.\n\n  \n\n### **Step #3 – Tailoring Your Outreach Messages**\n\nWhen it comes to outreach, personalization is key to unlocking those lead connections. [According to](https://www.forbes.com/sites/blakemorgan/2020/02/18/50-stats-showing-the-power-of-personalization/?sh=3c1bfab42a94)\n _,_ 91% of customers are more likely to shop with brands that provide personalized recommendations and 80% of customers are more likely to make a purchase from brands that provide personalized experiences.\n\n  \n\nEvery client and customer has different problems and goals. If you tap into those and show how you can make their life easier, you’ve got a winning lead on your hands!\n\n  \n\nNow we know what you’re thinking – personalizing every message would take forever. Sales reps already send so many emails; how can they customize each one?\n\n  \n\nHere’s the good news – it’s not as hard as it sounds with the right approach.\n\n  \n\nFirst, research each lead – their company, role, objectives, and pain points. Add these gems to your trusty database for easy access later.\n\n  \n\nHave a couple of outbound sales email templates ready, but use the intel to edit them and speak to each lead’s specific challenges. Provide tailored solutions based on what you’ve learned.\n\n  \n\nThis shows you truly get them and have their back. Personal outreach brings meaning to your service and gets conversations started.\n\n  \n\nEffective outbound isn’t just about immediate deals. It’s about providing real value on topics prospects care about to build trust and loyalty over the long haul.\n\n  \n\nWhen crafting outreach, precision is key. Here are some tips:\n\n  \n\n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    Keep it concise and scannable. Get to the value fast in case they’re busy. Use bullets!\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    Include personal details like names, companies, and roles to show you customized your email. Studies prove personalization improves open and response rates. An Experian study showed personalized emails have a [29% open rate](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/boost-your-open-rates-personalized-emails-key-successful-lisa-du-/)\n     compared to an 18% open rate for non-personalized emails.\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    Highlight unique value by addressing their exact pain points and goals upfront.\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    Offer a clear CTA so they know the next step, whether booking a meeting, getting a demo, or subscribing to content.\n    \n      \n    \n\n  \nThe right balance of personalization and concise value is outbound magic.\n\n  \n\nOh, and don’t worry if you don’t have the time or experience to do this yourself. Nowadays, you can use [AI Artisan Sales Reps](/ai-sales-agent)\n to handle everything on your behalf. Ava is trained to craft highly bespoke emails on behalf of your team. This gives you quality results without having to take up too much time.\n\n  \n\n### **Step #4 – Undertaking Outbound Sales Calls, Demos, and Meetings**\n\nAlright, your personalized outreach is getting results – prospects are responding and ready to chat. Now it’s time to guide them through the sales journey with calls, demos, and meetings.\n\n  \n\nBut here’s the key mindset shift: ditch the pitch and have an engaging conversation instead. Make it a two-way street!\n\n  \n\nListen closely to understand each prospect. A mere [13% of customers](https://blog.thebrevetgroup.com/21-mind-blowing-sales-stats)\n believe sales reps can understand their needs. If you can be the sales rep who cares, you’re going to stand out from the bunch.\n\n  \n\nA personalized, thoughtful approach allows you to refine your offer so it stays tailored to the customer. The goal isn’t to pressure prospects into buying. It’s to build real connections through helpful education and valuable insights.\n\n  \n\nWhen you take the time to engage prospects, you build trust and show how your solutions can help them. This thoughtful approach nurtures fruitful long-term relationships.\n\n  \n\nSo toss out the hard sell tactics. Successful outbound means focusing on the customer – listening first, understanding fully, and guiding gently toward solutions that are the right fit.\n\n  \n\nIt’s all about that human connection. Build rapport, provide value, and the deals will happen naturally. Outbound is so much more effective when it comes from the heart.\n\n  \n\nBooking calls and meetings can be time-consuming, but Artisan AI Sales Reps can book meetings into your calendar at scale.\n\n  \n\n**_Pro tip_**_: Use call recording and transcription tools to analyze sales calls and pinpoint areas where you can improve._\n\n  \n\n### **Step #5 – Sealing the Deal**\n\nAfter your personalized outreach, tailored conversations, and meticulous follow-ups, the prospect is ready to become a customer.\n\n  \n\nThe big moment is here, and it’s time to seal the deal!\n\n  \n\nRemember, your mission now is to problem-solve. If the prospect has any lingering concerns, it’s your job to alleviate them.\n\n  \n\nYou’ve put in the work to understand this prospect deeply. Now you need to guide them over the finish line, providing reassurance along the way.\n\n  \n\nYour persistence and consultative approach demonstrates that you’re committed to their success. When you keep their needs at the center, deals close themselves!\n\n  \n\nHere are some tips for effectively closing deals:\n\n  \n\n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    Be confident yet flexible in your approach\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    Understand the prospect’s decision-making process and adapt accordingly\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    Emphasize the concrete benefits and ROI of your product or service\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    Have pricing knowledge and be prepared to negotiate if needed\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    Follow up regularly but avoid being too pushy\n    \n      \n    \n\n  \nOr just let your trained, experienced AI reps do it for you.\n\n  \n\n### **Step #6 – Continuously Refine Your Outbound Sales Process**\n\nOutbound sales are always evolving, so you’ve got to keep improving your approach. This means taking the time to stay on top of data, customer feedback, and industry trends.\n\n  \n\nWays to step up your outbound game:\n\n  \n\n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    Build that pipeline! Prospect regularly and follow up with leads. Nurture it like a garden.\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    Make your messaging compelling and unique to each prospect. Get personal with it!\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    Use tools like email automation, social media, and CRM to streamline things. Embrace the tech!\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    Keep pace with industry changes and trends.\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    Analyze results to find areas to boost. Let the data guide you.\n    \n      \n    \n\n  \nImplementing these tips will enhance your current process and keep you ahead of the curve.\n\n  \n\nFeel empowered and confident to test new approaches and adapt. Never forget your goal is to provide value and forge lasting relationships.\n\n  \n\nOutbound excellence doesn’t happen overnight, but by optimizing relentlessly, you’ll get there!\n\n  \n\n**5 Impressive Sales Practices to Improve Your Outbound Efforts**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n![23](https://www.artisan.co/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.ctfassets.net%2Fkyprwggh4muz%2F9fknYoWuwaEUeBJUFevZx%2F5bbbc341d9cf91b10a1f82579ca5823b%2F23.png&w=3840&q=75)\n\n### **Be Customer Centric**\n\nIn a modern market, catering to customer experience is more important than ever. Customer-centric companies are [60% more profitable](https://blog.hubspot.com/service/customer-experience-trends)\n. Putting customers first should be your north star – guide all efforts by it, especially above quotas!\n\n  \n\nA customer-centric approach means conducting thorough research to craft messaging that resonates deeply with each person. This demonstrates you truly understand their pain points and are committed to helping.\n\n  \n\nWhen you lead with empathy and service, you build incredible trust and loyalty.\n\n  \n\nRemember – prospects want to be seen, heard, and helped. Not targeted, pitched, and pressured. Keep the focus on making their lives easier and helping them reach their goals.\n\n  \n\nCustomer-centricity is a mindset that shapes your whole approach. From initial outreach to closing the deal, always listen more than you speak. Seek to understand first, then to be understood.\n\n  \n\nHelp first, sell second.\n\n  \n\n### **Leverage Social Media**\n\nSocial media is a major outbound sales hack. In fact, according to Hubspot’s [2023 Social Strategy Trends Report](https://blog.hubspot.com/sales/social-selling-stats)\n, social media ranks third among the most effective sales channels. You can use LinkedIn, Twitter, and Instagram to connect with leads and build relationships like never before.\n\n  \n\nThere are plenty of ways to do this, from sharing valuable content to engaging your audience, and showing your thought leadership.\n\n  \n\nThe more value you provide, the more authority you have and the more leads you’ll attract.\n\n  \n\nHowever, the key is balance. Again, be helpful and insightful rather than salesy. Provide value without always pushing your product. Social media is about making connections through engaging content. Think long-form LinkedIn posts commenting on industry trends.\n\n  \n\nWith time and effort, you can turn casual networking into meaningful conversations that convert leads.\n\n  \n\nJust keep it authentic.\n\n  \n\n### **Streamline Communications, Messages, and Scripts**\n\nHaving streamlined templates and scripts is crucial to ensuring consistent, effective messaging. It also allows easier training of new team members and saves time long-term.\n\n  \n\nBut don’t just set it and forget it! Regularly optimize materials to improve clarity, relevance, and results. A/B test different versions. Update based on feedback. Tailor to new buyer personas. Add fresh examples and success stories.\n\n  \n\nRefined communications, messages, and scripts will take your outreach efforts to the next level. Put in the work upfront so each touchpoint moves smoothly forward.\n\n  \n\n### **Set Clear Goals and Track Progress**\n\nDefining specific outbound sales goals is step one. Break each goal down into measurable metrics you can track daily, weekly, and monthly. Monitor key numbers like contact rate, prospect meetings set, deals closed, revenue generated.\n\n  \n\nTracking progress gives you critical data to make smart improvements. Identify what’s working and double down on that. Find what’s not and switch up your approach.\n\n  \n\nAdjust your goals as needed and set reminders to analyze metrics regularly so you stay motivated and on track.\n\n  \n\nOutbound excellence is a marathon, not a sprint. With a clear roadmap and measurement system, you can achieve remarkable results.\n\n  \n\n### **Use Tools and Automation**\n\nTechnology has changed the outbound sales game! [76% of companies](https://explodingtopics.com/blog/marketing-automation-stats)\n now use marketing automation and 10% of customer journeys are actually _fully automated._ It’s easy to see why automation is becoming popular: 47% of CMOs say automation helps leads transition from marketing to sales faster.\n\n  \n\nTake advantage of tools and automation to streamline work and boost efficiency.\n\n  \n\nEmail tracking, scheduling, automated follow-ups – these tools help you stay organized and focused on actually connecting with people.\n\n  \n\nAI and chatbots can also help greatly, with [48% of customers](https://blog.hubspot.com/service/customer-experience-trends)\n comfortable with interactions managed by bots or AI. Artisan AI Sales Reps can do a litany of tasks for your team from drafting personalized emails to booking meetings to responding to prospects’ questions.\n\n  \n\nHowever, you need to take time to set clear goals, track progress, and leverage tech wisely. Mindless usage gets confusing, messy, and will cause more harm than good, so always remember – tech should enhance human connections, not replace them. Lead with empathy and care.\n\n  \n\nOutbound is powered by people.\n\n  \n\n**How to Use Digital Tools to Acquire Outbound Sales Mastery**\n--------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWhile the strategies here will improve your outbound sales, it’s crucial to leverage digital tools and technology for maximum success.\n\n  \n\nThe right tech stack empowers you to:\n\n  \n\n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    Automate repetitive tasks**,** so you focus on meaningful personal outreach\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    Work smarter and faster thanks to process efficiency\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    Minimize mistakes that slow things down\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    Organize the data flood into clear insights to guide your outreach\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    Ultimately close more deals by leveraging tech’s potential\n    \n      \n    \n\n  \nHere are some recommendations for getting started:\n\n  \n\n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    Sales engagement software to scale personalized emails and track responses\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    CRM to manage your pipeline and make data-driven decisions\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    Social listening tools to monitor mentions and engage leads in real-time\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    Sales intelligence for lead insights to personalize outreach\n    \n      \n    \n\n  \nThe core of what we’re talking about here is making sure you’re listening to your clients and leads and identifying what their needs are, and then addressing those needs as quickly, as accurately, and as comfortably as possible.\n\n  \n\nOf course, this can be a lengthy and time-consuming process where you’re relying on humans to get it exactly right with every single instance of communication.

With content marketing, social media marketing, blogging, and video dominating, you might think old-school outbound techniques are obsolete by now.\n\n  \n\nBut don’t be fooled – outbound is still going strong.\n\n  \n\nIn fact, [75% of executives](https://spotio.com/blog/sales-statistics/#outboundsales)\n state that they’d be willing to make an appointment or attend an event based on a single cold call or email, showcasing just how effective outbound can be.\n\n  \n\n_If conducted properly,_ that is.\n\n  \n\nBut enough about other companies – let’s talk about your business. How are your outbound efforts stacking up? Are you seeing the results you want? If not, you’ve come to the right place for a tune-up.\n\n  \n\nToday, we’ll explore how outbound creates opportunities instead of just waiting for inbound leads. I’ll share not only how to make outbound work for you but how to master the entire process from A to Z.\n\n  \n\nSo, buckle up and get ready to become an outbound sales pro. With the right strategy and execution, you can transform outbound from outdated to cutting-edge. Let’s stop wondering and start dominating!\n\n  \n\n**An Introduction to Outbound Sales**\n-------------------------------------\n\n![21](https://www.artisan.co/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.ctfassets.net%2Fkyprwggh4muz%2F4YUhg6rjsxZgr6LQxqCtyZ%2F8f8a6dfb707521da91b6aa3a39be877a%2F21.jpeg&w=3840&q=75)\n\nOutbound sales are the opposite of the “build it, and they will come” mindset.\n\n  \n\nInstead, you’re putting on those walking shoes, grabbing your Rolodex, and hitting the pavement to hunt down leads that are best suited for your business.\n\n  \n\nWhile both inbound and outbound sales aim to bring in customers and make sales, outbound sales offer a unique advantage compared with the inbound process.\n\n  \n\nOne word: **control**.\n\n  \n\nWith outbound sales, you steer the ship and chart your own course. Instead of passively relying on leads finding you, you actively seek them out on your terms. And the more time and resources you dedicate, the more prospects you’ll uncover.\n\n  \n\nWhat’s more, outbound gives you total control to build your pipeline precisely how you want, focusing on the targets and leads you to deem most promising.\n\n  \n\nNo more waiting and hoping – just good old-fashioned hustle.\n\n  \n\nThese are just a handful of the many advantages outbound sales offers. If you want to grab the reins and take charge of your pipeline, outbound is the way to go!\n\n  \n\n### **What’s the Difference Between Outbound and Inbound Sales?**\n\nWith inbound sales, you take a more passive approach. Like casting a wide net and seeing what fish swim into it, you create content, optimize for search, and run campaigns hoping to attract leads.\n\n  \n\nIf someone reaches out (or you hook them) after seeing your stuff, that’s inbound working its magic!\n\n  \n\nOutbound sales are the opposite – think door-to-door salesperson vs. bait shop owner.\n\n  \n\nInstead of waiting around, you grab your tackle box and actively head out into the world to hunt for leads. This requires research to find potential customers, crafting personalized messages, and reaching out through email, social media, calls, etc.\n\n  \n\nWhile inbound and outbound sales effectively have a similar goal, inbound marketing is sitting back with a Mai Tai, hoping the fish bite. Outbound is putting on waders, grabbing a net, and scooping up fish whether they’re biting or not.\n\n  \n\nRemember, there is no inbound vs outbound sales war. Both are valid strategies with pros and cons! One is reactive, one proactive. Choose the approach that fits your sales style and business goals.\n\n  \n\n### **The Problem With Modern Outbound Sales**\n\nLet’s address the elephant in the room – many businesses are struggling with outbound sales.\n\n  \n\nAccording to [a 2022 Hubspot report](https://www.hubspot.com/marketing-statistics?)\n, only 16% of marketers say outbound practices lead to quality leads. Ineffective outbound sales strategies prove this, with [over half of outbound marketers](https://www.zendesk.co.uk/blog/sales-statistics/)\n admitting their approaches just aren’t working.\n\n  \n\nThere are plenty of fingers pointing at issues like:\n\n  \n\n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    Poor communication between teams\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    Not having enough info to properly engage prospects\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    Skyrocketing customer expectations\n    \n      \n    \n\n  \nThe bottom line? Despite time and money invested in outbound, results are stagnant, draining, and unproductive.\n\n  \n\nHowever, the problem is not that outbound sales are inherently bad practice so much as a lack of clear strategy.\n\n  \n\nThe core issue is simple: many companies see outbound as a numbers game focused on quantity over quality. But genuine connection is so critical!\n\n  \n\nThink about how often you open your inbox to find it crammed with messages from companies you don’t care about. Annoying, right?\n\n  \n\nBusinesses are churning out content and outreach, but it falls flat because it’s so impersonal. And with more subpar digital tools automating everything, sales teams blast generic pitches to thousands with little success.\n\n  \n\nThe result? Prospects feel overwhelmed by impersonal outreach, so response rates drop, giving outbound a bad reputation.\n\n  \n\nFor outbound to really soar, your outbound sales approach needs an overhaul.\n\n  \n\n**The Benefits of an Effective Outbound Sales Strategy**\n--------------------------------------------------------\n\nExecuted correctly, outbound sales are one of the most powerful strategies for keeping your pipeline full and closing deals. They let you directly contact potential customers and have meaningful conversations.\n\n  \n\nEffective outbound also enables you to:\n\n  \n\n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    Build relationships with prospects before they even realize they need you\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    Control the narrative and spotlight your unique value proposition\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    Stand out from competitors by offering personalized solutions for pain points\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    Save time and resources by targeting only qualified, bullseye outbound leads\n    \n      \n    \n\n  \nWhen done right, outbound lets you engage leads on your terms and steer them through the buyer’s journey. It’s like having a blueprint to build strong relationships and promote your solutions.\n\n  \n\nOutbound sales can be effective when done right, and statistics back this up. Companies that don’t cold call [experience 42% less growth](https://about.crunchbase.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Cold_Calling_Tips_Sale_Reps-V4.pdf?hubs_content=blog.hubspot.com%252Fsales%252Fsales-statistics&hubs_content-cta=Sales%2520Prospecting%2520Statistics)\n than those who do. [71% of buyers](https://www.rainsalestraining.com/blog/b2b-sales-funnel-stages)\n are open to talking to sellers when they’re actively looking for new solutions.\n\n  \n\nA stellar outbound sales strategy executed flawlessly can be an absolute game-changer for driving deals. Turn cold calling into warm conversations, and watch your pipeline heat up!\n\n  \n\n**What Does a Successful Outbound Sales Process Look Like? Six Key Steps**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n![22](https://www.artisan.co/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.ctfassets.net%2Fkyprwggh4muz%2F3RstkYKb1ZTseCbHaHhEVH%2F2033fb8f72b8a9d391e2a73cafdad937%2F22.png&w=3840&q=75)\n\nWhile the approach varies from business to business, a generally successful outbound sales process will look like this:\n\n  \n\n### **Step #1 – Research and Identify Your Target Audience**\n\nBefore reaching out, it’s crucial to fully understand your ideal customer. Effective selling means grasping their desires and needs. The more intel you gather, the better you can customize your outreach.\n\n  \n\nThis approach hugely benefits your sales reps, especially when dealing with diverse clients or a wide range of products/services.\n\n  \n\nUtilize data-driven research tools to pinpoint companies or people matching your target audience profile.\n\n  \n\nMarket segmentation is key here, and you’ll need to ask critical questions like:\n\n  \n\n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    Who is your target audience?\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    What types of businesses are you aiming to sell to?\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    Who are the decision-makers in these companies?\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    Have you built a detailed buyer persona?\n    \n      \n    \n\n  \nWithout comprehensive answers, your team may lack the vital details to connect with the right folks. In fact, [42% of sales reps](https://spotio.com/blog/sales-statistics/)\n feel they don’t have enough information about prospects prior to making calls.\n\n  \n\nDo your homework and get crystal clear on your ideal customer. This level of insight takes your outbound efforts from generic to tailored, and you’ll know exactly how to resonate with each prospect and guide them to your solutions.\n\n  \n\nThis is highly targeted outreach at its finest.\n\n  \n\nTools like [Artisan AI’s Sales Reps](/ai-sales-agent)\n can help speed up this process. Ava, Artisan’s AI sales rep, comes with over 265 million built-in leads to help you create a targeted list of potential contacts.\n\n  \n\n### **Step #2 – Creating a Lead Database**\n\nAlright, you’ve identified your dream customers. Now it’s time to gather their deets to connect with them. The best way is an organized lead database.\n\n  \n\nWe know, databases sound boring. But having all your prospects in one searchable place is crucial for your sales reps. They’ll have everything needed to target the right folks and crush it.\n\n  \n\nWe’re talking essential info like:\n\n  \n\n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    Email addresses\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    Phone numbers\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    Social media profiles (primarily LinkedIn)\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    Company name and website\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    Job title and department\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    Pain points they may have\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    Other useful personal details (birthdays, preferences, etc)\n    \n      \n    \n\n  \nAnd here’s a pro tip – treat your database like a garden, not a chore. Nurture it! Add new leads, update info, and weed out outdated contacts. This keeps your prospect list fresh and fertile for sales success.\n\n  \n\nHaving this organized and up-to-date resource makes targeting and outreach way easier. You can filter leads by location, company, role, and more to create perfect outreach lists.\n\n  \n\nSo embrace the database! It may not be sexy, but it’ll help you get results and forge great relationships.\n\n  \n\n### **Step #3 – Tailoring Your Outreach Messages**\n\nWhen it comes to outreach, personalization is key to unlocking those lead connections. [According to](https://www.forbes.com/sites/blakemorgan/2020/02/18/50-stats-showing-the-power-of-personalization/?sh=3c1bfab42a94)\n _,_ 91% of customers are more likely to shop with brands that provide personalized recommendations and 80% of customers are more likely to make a purchase from brands that provide personalized experiences.\n\n  \n\nEvery client and customer has different problems and goals. If you tap into those and show how you can make their life easier, you’ve got a winning lead on your hands!\n\n  \n\nNow we know what you’re thinking – personalizing every message would take forever. Sales reps already send so many emails; how can they customize each one?\n\n  \n\nHere’s the good news – it’s not as hard as it sounds with the right approach.\n\n  \n\nFirst, research each lead – their company, role, objectives, and pain points. Add these gems to your trusty database for easy access later.\n\n  \n\nHave a couple of outbound sales email templates ready, but use the intel to edit them and speak to each lead’s specific challenges. Provide tailored solutions based on what you’ve learned.\n\n  \n\nThis shows you truly get them and have their back. Personal outreach brings meaning to your service and gets conversations started.\n\n  \n\nEffective outbound isn’t just about immediate deals. It’s about providing real value on topics prospects care about to build trust and loyalty over the long haul.\n\n  \n\nWhen crafting outreach, precision is key. Here are some tips:\n\n  \n\n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    Keep it concise and scannable. Get to the value fast in case they’re busy. Use bullets!\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    Include personal details like names, companies, and roles to show you customized your email. Studies prove personalization improves open and response rates. An Experian study showed personalized emails have a [29% open rate](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/boost-your-open-rates-personalized-emails-key-successful-lisa-du-/)\n     compared to an 18% open rate for non-personalized emails.\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    Highlight unique value by addressing their exact pain points and goals upfront.\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    Offer a clear CTA so they know the next step, whether booking a meeting, getting a demo, or subscribing to content.\n    \n      \n    \n\n  \nThe right balance of personalization and concise value is outbound magic.\n\n  \n\nOh, and don’t worry if you don’t have the time or experience to do this yourself. Nowadays, you can use [AI Artisan Sales Reps](/ai-sales-agent)\n to handle everything on your behalf. Ava is trained to craft highly bespoke emails on behalf of your team. This gives you quality results without having to take up too much time.\n\n  \n\n### **Step #4 – Undertaking Outbound Sales Calls, Demos, and Meetings**\n\nAlright, your personalized outreach is getting results – prospects are responding and ready to chat. Now it’s time to guide them through the sales journey with calls, demos, and meetings.\n\n  \n\nBut here’s the key mindset shift: ditch the pitch and have an engaging conversation instead. Make it a two-way street!\n\n  \n\nListen closely to understand each prospect. A mere [13% of customers](https://blog.thebrevetgroup.com/21-mind-blowing-sales-stats)\n believe sales reps can understand their needs. If you can be the sales rep who cares, you’re going to stand out from the bunch.\n\n  \n\nA personalized, thoughtful approach allows you to refine your offer so it stays tailored to the customer. The goal isn’t to pressure prospects into buying. It’s to build real connections through helpful education and valuable insights.\n\n  \n\nWhen you take the time to engage prospects, you build trust and show how your solutions can help them. This thoughtful approach nurtures fruitful long-term relationships.\n\n  \n\nSo toss out the hard sell tactics. Successful outbound means focusing on the customer – listening first, understanding fully, and guiding gently toward solutions that are the right fit.\n\n  \n\nIt’s all about that human connection. Build rapport, provide value, and the deals will happen naturally. Outbound is so much more effective when it comes from the heart.\n\n  \n\nBooking calls and meetings can be time-consuming, but Artisan AI Sales Reps can book meetings into your calendar at scale.\n\n  \n\n**_Pro tip_**_: Use call recording and transcription tools to analyze sales calls and pinpoint areas where you can improve._\n\n  \n\n### **Step #5 – Sealing the Deal**\n\nAfter your personalized outreach, tailored conversations, and meticulous follow-ups, the prospect is ready to become a customer.\n\n  \n\nThe big moment is here, and it’s time to seal the deal!\n\n  \n\nRemember, your mission now is to problem-solve. If the prospect has any lingering concerns, it’s your job to alleviate them.\n\n  \n\nYou’ve put in the work to understand this prospect deeply. Now you need to guide them over the finish line, providing reassurance along the way.\n\n  \n\nYour persistence and consultative approach demonstrates that you’re committed to their success. When you keep their needs at the center, deals close themselves!\n\n  \n\nHere are some tips for effectively closing deals:\n\n  \n\n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    Be confident yet flexible in your approach\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    Understand the prospect’s decision-making process and adapt accordingly\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    Emphasize the concrete benefits and ROI of your product or service\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    Have pricing knowledge and be prepared to negotiate if needed\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    Follow up regularly but avoid being too pushy\n    \n      \n    \n\n  \nOr just let your trained, experienced AI reps do it for you.\n\n  \n\n### **Step #6 – Continuously Refine Your Outbound Sales Process**\n\nOutbound sales are always evolving, so you’ve got to keep improving your approach. This means taking the time to stay on top of data, customer feedback, and industry trends.\n\n  \n\nWays to step up your outbound game:\n\n  \n\n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    Build that pipeline! Prospect regularly and follow up with leads. Nurture it like a garden.\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    Make your messaging compelling and unique to each prospect. Get personal with it!\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    Use tools like email automation, social media, and CRM to streamline things. Embrace the tech!\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    Keep pace with industry changes and trends.\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    Analyze results to find areas to boost. Let the data guide you.\n    \n      \n    \n\n  \nImplementing these tips will enhance your current process and keep you ahead of the curve.\n\n  \n\nFeel empowered and confident to test new approaches and adapt. Never forget your goal is to provide value and forge lasting relationships.\n\n  \n\nOutbound excellence doesn’t happen overnight, but by optimizing relentlessly, you’ll get there!\n\n  \n\n**5 Impressive Sales Practices to Improve Your Outbound Efforts**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n![23](https://www.artisan.co/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.ctfassets.net%2Fkyprwggh4muz%2F9fknYoWuwaEUeBJUFevZx%2F5bbbc341d9cf91b10a1f82579ca5823b%2F23.png&w=3840&q=75)\n\n### **Be Customer Centric**\n\nIn a modern market, catering to customer experience is more important than ever. Customer-centric companies are [60% more profitable](https://blog.hubspot.com/service/customer-experience-trends)\n. Putting customers first should be your north star – guide all efforts by it, especially above quotas!\n\n  \n\nA customer-centric approach means conducting thorough research to craft messaging that resonates deeply with each person. This demonstrates you truly understand their pain points and are committed to helping.\n\n  \n\nWhen you lead with empathy and service, you build incredible trust and loyalty.\n\n  \n\nRemember – prospects want to be seen, heard, and helped. Not targeted, pitched, and pressured. Keep the focus on making their lives easier and helping them reach their goals.\n\n  \n\nCustomer-centricity is a mindset that shapes your whole approach. From initial outreach to closing the deal, always listen more than you speak. Seek to understand first, then to be understood.\n\n  \n\nHelp first, sell second.\n\n  \n\n### **Leverage Social Media**\n\nSocial media is a major outbound sales hack. In fact, according to Hubspot’s [2023 Social Strategy Trends Report](https://blog.hubspot.com/sales/social-selling-stats)\n, social media ranks third among the most effective sales channels. You can use LinkedIn, Twitter, and Instagram to connect with leads and build relationships like never before.\n\n  \n\nThere are plenty of ways to do this, from sharing valuable content to engaging your audience, and showing your thought leadership.\n\n  \n\nThe more value you provide, the more authority you have and the more leads you’ll attract.\n\n  \n\nHowever, the key is balance. Again, be helpful and insightful rather than salesy. Provide value without always pushing your product. Social media is about making connections through engaging content. Think long-form LinkedIn posts commenting on industry trends.\n\n  \n\nWith time and effort, you can turn casual networking into meaningful conversations that convert leads.\n\n  \n\nJust keep it authentic.\n\n  \n\n### **Streamline Communications, Messages, and Scripts**\n\nHaving streamlined templates and scripts is crucial to ensuring consistent, effective messaging. It also allows easier training of new team members and saves time long-term.\n\n  \n\nBut don’t just set it and forget it! Regularly optimize materials to improve clarity, relevance, and results. A/B test different versions. Update based on feedback. Tailor to new buyer personas. Add fresh examples and success stories.\n\n  \n\nRefined communications, messages, and scripts will take your outreach efforts to the next level. Put in the work upfront so each touchpoint moves smoothly forward.\n\n  \n\n### **Set Clear Goals and Track Progress**\n\nDefining specific outbound sales goals is step one. Break each goal down into measurable metrics you can track daily, weekly, and monthly. Monitor key numbers like contact rate, prospect meetings set, deals closed, revenue generated.\n\n  \n\nTracking progress gives you critical data to make smart improvements. Identify what’s working and double down on that. Find what’s not and switch up your approach.\n\n  \n\nAdjust your goals as needed and set reminders to analyze metrics regularly so you stay motivated and on track.\n\n  \n\nOutbound excellence is a marathon, not a sprint. With a clear roadmap and measurement system, you can achieve remarkable results.\n\n  \n\n### **Use Tools and Automation**\n\nTechnology has changed the outbound sales game!

Lead with empathy and care.\n\n  \n\nOutbound is powered by people.\n\n  \n\n**How to Use Digital Tools to Acquire Outbound Sales Mastery**\n--------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWhile the strategies here will improve your outbound sales, it’s crucial to leverage digital tools and technology for maximum success.\n\n  \n\nThe right tech stack empowers you to:\n\n  \n\n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    Automate repetitive tasks**,** so you focus on meaningful personal outreach\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    Work smarter and faster thanks to process efficiency\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    Minimize mistakes that slow things down\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    Organize the data flood into clear insights to guide your outreach\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    Ultimately close more deals by leveraging tech’s potential\n    \n      \n    \n\n  \nHere are some recommendations for getting started:\n\n  \n\n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    Sales engagement software to scale personalized emails and track responses\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    CRM to manage your pipeline and make data-driven decisions\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    Social listening tools to monitor mentions and engage leads in real-time\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    Sales intelligence for lead insights to personalize outreach\n    \n      \n    \n\n  \nThe core of what we’re talking about here is making sure you’re listening to your clients and leads and identifying what their needs are, and then addressing those needs as quickly, as accurately, and as comfortably as possible.\n\n  \n\nOf course, this can be a lengthy and time-consuming process where you’re relying on humans to get it exactly right with every single instance of communication.

This isn’t just another email shot in the dark; it’s a well-researched, finely-tuned arrow hitting the bullseye of your prospective client’s attention. That’s the power of a cold email campaign when executed at scale.\n\n  \n\nYou might be thinking, “Isn’t cold emailing a numbers game?” While that is a common belief, times have changed. Today’s savvy sales professionals know it’s about much more than just volume. Cold email marketing strategy is about striking the right chord with the right message at the right time.\n\n  \n\nIn this comprehensive guide, we’re going to walk through the steps to set up a cold email campaign that doesn’t just reach out to a vast audience but engages them, speaks to their needs, and gets results.\n\n  \n\nWe’re not just talking about the same old techniques you’ve read a dozen times. We’re diving into lesser-known, innovative tactics that make your emails stand out in a crowded inbox.\n\n  \n\n**What Is Cold Emailing? Understanding Your Strategy**\n------------------------------------------------------\n\nSending a cold email sometimes feels like you’re just taking a wild guess and hoping for the best, but with the right strategy, it becomes a precision instrument in your marketing toolkit.\n\n  \n\nCold emailing is not just about sending out a mass of emails following typical sales templates. It’s about starting a conversation. Each email should be seen as an opening line in a dialogue with a potential client or partner.\n\n  \n\nAt its core, cold emailing is about connecting with another human being. Behind every email address is a person who is busy, discerning, and inundated with similar outreach efforts. Your email needs to cut through that noise by being relevant, respectful, and valuable.\n\n  \n\nA common problem with cold emails is that they focus too much on the sender and not enough on the recipient. To avoid this, frame your email around a problem that the recipient is likely facing and position your offering as the solution. The best cold email campaigns show that you understand their challenges and have done your homework.\n\n  \n\nAccording to a [2023 study by Saleshandy](https://outreachmonks.com/how-to-verify-email-addresses-and-improve-your-email-outreach-results/)\n, the average open rate for cold emails is around 24%. This highlights the importance of crafting an email that stands out and immediately presents value to the recipient.\n\n  \n![1](https://www.artisan.co/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.ctfassets.net%2Fkyprwggh4muz%2F1f8R2HIv76H7XWA1JOUgqy%2F0306940d409581899c838eee6a072623%2F1.png&w=3840&q=75)\n\n**Cold Email Campaigns: The Preparatory Work**\n----------------------------------------------\n\nBefore you can launch a successful cold email campaign, there’s a significant amount of groundwork that needs to be laid. This preparatory phase is where you set the foundation for your campaign’s success.\n\n  \n\n### **Identifying Your Target Audience**\n\nThe first step in any cold email campaign is to identify your recipient. This isn’t about casting a wide net and hoping for the best. The best cold email strategy comes down to precision targeting.\n\n  \n\nYou want to ensure that your message lands in the inbox of someone who has the authority and interest to engage with your offer.\n\n  \n\nTo truly revolutionize your sales strategy, meet [Ava, the Artisan Sales Rep](https://artisan.co/ava-sales-rep/)\n. Ava isn’t just another tool, she’s a transformative digital worker who takes lead discovery to a whole new level.\n\n  \n\nImagine having access to a staggering 265 million contacts and 65 unique data points at your fingertips. This is far beyond what traditional platforms like LinkedIn Sales Navigator offer.\n\n  \n![2](https://www.artisan.co/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.ctfassets.net%2Fkyprwggh4muz%2F1erA2U3yxRGAH0DMAXBZSL%2F8c1ac5495811dad5d057c1c5decbb2ae%2F2.png&w=3840&q=75)\n\nThis allows for precision targeting, ensuring your message lands in the inbox of someone who not only has authority but also a strong interest in engaging with your offer.\n\n  \n![3](https://www.artisan.co/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.ctfassets.net%2Fkyprwggh4muz%2F5By8AqFGFNuzv1NS6uoLlh%2Fda2e0fca10dfe968aa435f40e76c1d8e%2F3.jpeg&w=3840&q=75)\n\nPrecision targeting creates a list of individuals most likely to benefit from your product or service. You’re not merely finding any contact within a company. You’re finding the decision-makers, the influencers, and the champions who can drive action.\n\n  \n\n### **Building a Quality Cold Email Campaign Contact List**\n\nOnce you’ve identified your target audience, the next step is to build a contact list – and not just any list, but a quality list! This is where many cold email campaigns falter. They prioritize quantity over quality, leading to high bounce rates and low engagement.\n\n  \n\nThe solution?\n\n  \n\nCold email campaign software like Hunter.io. Not only does Hunter.io help you find email addresses, but it also verifies them. This is a critical step in maintaining a high sender reputation. Ava also comes equipped to help your company craft a good cold email list, with millions of potential contacts built-in from the get-go.\n\n  \n![4](https://www.artisan.co/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.ctfassets.net%2Fkyprwggh4muz%2F2JqUstBeA4oQu5pShJKbAh%2F787b434b448403f8cfb8017c53bcde2f%2F4.png&w=3840&q=75)\n\nAccording to a [2023 report by outreachmonks](https://outreachmonks.com/how-to-verify-email-addresses-and-improve-your-email-outreach-results/)\n, verified email campaigns experience a significant drop in bounce rates, amounting to 90%. This statistic underscores the importance of email verification in ensuring your messages reach their intended recipients.\n\n  \n![5](https://www.artisan.co/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.ctfassets.net%2Fkyprwggh4muz%2F60oGwW9HmBGSqZSKRDyQyS%2F0016d8b0b03221dd5730d849f63c6e9e%2F5.png&w=3840&q=75)\n\n### **Crafting Your Value Proposition**\n\nYour value proposition is the core of your cold email campaign. It’s the reason why the recipient should care about what you have to say.\n\n  \n\nTo craft a compelling value proposition, you need to understand what’s currently relevant in your industry. This is where Google Trends can be an invaluable resource. By showing you what’s trending, you can align your value proposition with the interests and needs of your prospects.\n\n  \n![6](https://www.artisan.co/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.ctfassets.net%2Fkyprwggh4muz%2F7rXKGs5bE2FFGA9VDCY8wX%2F691eeb796b6f01173a84ab740770d01f%2F6.png&w=3840&q=75)\n\nSales Rep Artisan’s Ava also shines here. She not only addresses but actively solves key problems in outbound sales.\n\n  \n\nAva, with her unique touch, crafts personalized email sequences that reach out to thousands of your prospects. Each email is carefully designed to resonate with the individual needs and concerns of every recipient.\n\n  \n\nThis approach not only brings your value proposition into the spotlight but also makes it more relatable and impactful.\n\n  \n\nIt’s not just about what you offer but about what your offer does for the potential customer. How does your product or service make their life easier? How does it solve a pain point? That’s what your value proposition should convey.\n\n  \n\n**Writing Cold Email**s for Your Campaign\n-----------------------------------------\n\nCrafting an effective cold email is an art that balances brevity with persuasion. It’s about making an immediate impact with words that are both engaging and respectful of the recipient’s time.\n\n  \n\nHere’s how to ensure your cold email stands out and prompts a response.\n\n  \n\n### **The Subject Line**\n\nThe subject line is your first and often only chance to make an impression in a cold email campaign. It should be a beacon in a sea of emails, compelling enough to prompt an open, yet honest enough to set realistic expectations for what’s inside.\n\n  \n\nAccording to a 2023 report by Mailmunch, the [average email open rate](https://www.mailmunch.com/blog/email-open-rate)\n across all industries is 21.33%. This statistic highlights the challenge and importance of crafting a subject line that stands out.\n\n  \n\nTo achieve this, use actionable language that conveys urgency or benefit. For instance, “Unlock X% more efficiency with our tool” is direct and suggests a clear advantage. Avoid generic phrases like “monthly newsletter” or “just checking in,” which are easily overlooked.\n\n  \n![7](https://www.artisan.co/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.ctfassets.net%2Fkyprwggh4muz%2FYsrnP2aBErVify4ExEexG%2F4fadead94e4d705fac54300fcf6c60b2%2F7.png&w=3840&q=75)\n\n### **The Email Body**\n\nThe body of your email is where you make your pitch, but remember the human behind the screen. This is not a monologue. It’s the start of a conversation.\n\n  \n\nThe key is to be concise but powerful. Focus on how you can help the recipient, not just on what you’re offering.\n\n  \n\nBegin with a personalized greeting to establish a connection. Then, succinctly state the problem you’ve identified that pertains to their business.\n\n  \n\nFollow this with your value proposition: a solution that’s not just beneficial but tailored to their specific needs. Use bullet points or short paragraphs to keep the content digestible.\n\n  \n\nTools like Grammarly and Hemingway Editor can ensure your writing is clear, concise, and free of errors, which is essential when you have only a few sentences to make your case.\n\n  \n![8](https://www.artisan.co/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.ctfassets.net%2Fkyprwggh4muz%2F7JKtJOFgDjV4CBozX9nqIg%2F85932d6a8478310a35ef1cacf053b40c%2F8.png&w=3840&q=75)\n\n### **The Call-to-Action**\n\nThe call-to-action (CTA) is the culmination of your cold email. It should be a natural next step for the reader, whether it’s to schedule a call, download a whitepaper, or simply reply for more information.\n\n  \n\nMake it as frictionless as possible. For instance, embed a link to a scheduling tool like [Calendly](https://calendly.com/)\n to remove barriers to booking a meeting.\n\n  \n\nYour CTA should be clear and direct, avoiding any ambiguity about what you want the recipient to do next. Phrases like “Let’s talk” or “See how with a free demo” are more inviting and less aggressive than “Buy now” or “Sign up today.”\n\n  \n![14](https://www.artisan.co/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.ctfassets.net%2Fkyprwggh4muz%2F1aMjT3XlmtVBg4Z8oCIPSW%2F645f40e80b67ec5adb3195061d2a4f33%2F14.png&w=3840&q=75)\n\nRemember, the goal of a cold email is not necessarily to close a sale but to initiate a dialogue. By crafting a subject line that piques interest, an email body that speaks directly to the recipient’s needs, and a CTA that guides them towards the next step, you set the stage for a productive conversation that could lead to a valuable business relationship.\n\n  \n\n**The Cold Email Campaign Technical Setup**\n-------------------------------------------\n\nSetting up a cold email campaign involves more than just crafting compelling content. It’s also about ensuring that your emails actually reach the inbox. This is where the technical setup comes into play, and it’s a step you can’t afford to overlook. Determining the best cold email software and tools for your campaign are crucial to success.\n\n  \n\nLet’s have a peek into the intricacies of this process.\n\n  \n\n### **Email Automation and Tracking Tools**\n\nEmail automation tools are the engines that power large-scale cold email campaigns. Platforms like Mailchimp are renowned for their user-friendly automation workflows, which allow you to send out emails based on triggers and schedules you define.\n\n  \n![9](https://www.artisan.co/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.ctfassets.net%2Fkyprwggh4muz%2F7kVzQQKhyns2r4MU8yZCwI%2F1f90a224a383b60f113edb8610b3f68b%2F9.png&w=3840&q=75)\n\nThis helps ensure that your emails are sent at the optimal time for engagement.\n\n  \n\nOn the other hand, SendGrid offers robust scalability for larger campaigns, making it a go-to for businesses that need to send out a high volume of emails without sacrificing deliverability.\n\n  \n\nTracking is another critical component of your technical setup. Tools like Yesware and Mailtrack provide valuable insights into open and click rates, which are vital for understanding how recipients are engaging with your emails.\n\n  \n![10](https://www.artisan.co/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.ctfassets.net%2Fkyprwggh4muz%2F1xnbdI7YJK22PWBUmxak9p%2F36bef0f896984c0df7c3529cdba6671f%2F10.png&w=3840&q=75)\n\nThis data is vital for refining your approach and improving the effectiveness of your campaigns.\n\n  \n\n### **Ensuring Deliverability**\n\nDeliverability is the cornerstone of a successful cold email campaign. If your emails don’t reach the inbox, nothing else matters.\n\n  \n\nThis is where MXToolbox comes in. It’s a comprehensive tool that checks your domain against blacklists and helps monitor the health of your email server.\n\n  \n\nKeeping your domain off blacklists and ensuring your server is running smoothly are essential for maintaining high deliverability rates.\n\n  \n\nA recent [2023 Email Deliverability Benchmark Report by Validity](https://www.validity.com/resource-center/2023-email-deliverability-benchmark-report/)\n revealed that 1 in 10 emails are not accepted by receiving mailbox providers. The report also highlighted that deliverability at major global mailbox providers like Microsoft, AOL, Gmail, and Yahoo is 86%, which is higher than the global average.\n\n  \n\nThis underscores the importance of monitoring deliverability metrics and taking proactive steps to address any issues.\n\n  \n\n**Scaling Your Cold Email Campaign**\n------------------------------------\n\nScaling a cold email campaign effectively requires a delicate balance between personalization and automation.\n\n  \n\nThe challenge lies in maintaining the feel of one-on-one communication while reaching hundreds or thousands of prospects.\n\n  \n\nThis is where Sales Rep Artisan’s Ava becomes invaluable. Imagine a tool so powerful that it effortlessly scales with your growing needs, managing thousands of prospects each month.\n\n  \n\nWhether you’re just starting out or expanding rapidly, Ava adapts seamlessly, offering plans that range from handling 50 prospects to an unlimited number.\n\n  \n\nWith Ava, you’re not just running a campaign; you’re building a community. And the best part? You can do all this without relying on a myriad of third-party tools. Ava is your all-in-one solution, simplifying your campaign management with a user-friendly approach, free from complicated jargon.\n\n  \n\nWhether you choose the Free, Gold, Platinum, or Enterprise package, Ava adapts to your scaling needs without losing the personal touch.\n\n  \n\nOn the other hand, personalizing each email is time-consuming and not feasible at scale. The solution is to find the right mix of automation and personal touch.\n\n  \n\n### **Automating the Process**\n\nTools like [Outreach](https://www.outreach.io/)\n and [Salesloft](https://help.salesloft.com/s/?language=en_US)\n offer sophisticated automation options that can send emails based on recipient behavior. For instance, if a recipient opens an email but doesn’t click any links, they can be automatically sent a follow-up email with a more direct call to action.\n\n  \n\nLet’s look at an example from a case study. A B2B analytics and data provider wanted to scale their cold outreach email . They used [InboxAlly](https://www.inboxally.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Case-Study-Cold-Emailing.pdf)\n to warm up a new domain and start sending 1,000 to 2,000 cold emails per day. By leveraging automation and personalization, they saw a significant increase in their open and reply rates, demonstrating the effectiveness of a balanced approach.\n\n  \n\n### **A/B Testing**\n\nA/B testing is crucial for understanding what resonates with your audience. By testing different subject lines, email copy, and CTAs, you can refine your approach.\n\n  \n\nGoogle Analytics can be integrated with your email platform to track which variations perform best, allowing you to optimize future campaigns.\n\n  \n![11](https://www.artisan.co/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.ctfassets.net%2Fkyprwggh4muz%2F0g0BKZBbVaOYPB8yKud3E%2Fdf072a234573d79c2a05720630acfff5%2F11.png&w=3840&q=75)\n\n### **Analyzing and Acting on Data**\n\nThe data from your email platform will provide insights into open rates, click-through rates, and conversion rates.\n\n  \n\nBy analyzing this data, you can identify trends and patterns, such as the best times to send emails or the most effective messaging for different segments of your audience. This can help you continually improve and optimize your cold email campaign.\n\n  \n\n**Advanced Cold Email Strategies**\n----------------------------------\n\nWhen it comes to cold emailing, the magic is in the details. Advanced strategies in personalization and leveraging social proof can significantly enhance the effectiveness of your campaign.\n\n  \n\nHere’s how to incorporate these tactics at scale.\n\n  \n\n### **Personalization at Scale**\n\nThe challenge with personalization at scale is maintaining the efficiency of your campaign while ensuring each cold email feels unique and tailored to the recipient. Generic emails are easy to spot and often ignored, but crafting individual emails for thousands of prospects is not feasible.\n\n  \n\nHubSpot’s personalization tokens are a game-changer for scaling your cold email strategy. These tokens allow you to insert specific details about each recipient into your emails automatically.\n\n  \n\nAva can help automate personalization, ghostwriting individualized emails with AI on behalf of your team. Ava also optimizes her approach over time as she learns organically how to best interact with potential leads.\n\n  \n![12](https://www.artisan.co/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.ctfassets.net%2Fkyprwggh4muz%2FBOHgJPTUgBtGfbHPd4eqa%2F247bfbe4dd26d604c98bbeb8a21eac2f%2F12.png&w=3840&q=75)\n\nFor example, you can address recipients by their first name, mention their company, or reference a recent interaction they had with your content.\n\n  \n\nAirbnb’s email marketing campaigns are a testament to the power of personalization. They use customer data to send personalized recommendations and updates, making each communication feel bespoke.\n\n  \n\nFor instance, they might send an email featuring rental options in a city a customer has searched for, along with activities in that area. This level of personalization at scale has been crucial to Airbnb’s customer engagement strategy.\n\n  \n\n### **Using Social Proof**\n\nIncorporating testimonials and user reviews in your emails can significantly boost credibility and trust. Testimonial.to is a platform that allows you to seamlessly integrate social proof into your emails.\n\n  \n![13](https://www.artisan.co/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.ctfassets.net%2Fkyprwggh4muz%2F7jy4JV602AuOAcGJeyZbIj%2F5884040bd05f7c85ceac70a68dbaf8ba%2F13.png&w=3840&q=75)\n\nBy showing prospects that others have had success with your product or service, you can increase the persuasive power of your cold email campaign.\n\n  \n\n### **Following Up**\n\nTiming is everything in follow-ups. [Boomerang for Gmail](https://www.boomeranggmail.com/)\n allows you to schedule your follow-up emails at the optimal time, increasing the likelihood of a response. This tool can also remind you to follow up if you don’t receive a reply within a certain timeframe.\n\n  \n\n**Cold Email Legal and Ethical Considerations**\n-----------------------------------------------\n\nWhen scaling cold email campaigns, it’s not just about the strategies and tools you use to achieve success; it’s also about navigating the complex landscape of legal and ethical considerations. Here’s a detailed look at what you need to keep in mind.\n\n  \n\nThe primary challenge in this area is ensuring that your cold email campaign complies with various laws and regulations, which can vary significantly by country or region. Non-compliance can result in severe penalties, including fines and damage to your company’s reputation.\n\n  \n\nNow let’s have a look at some of the solutions.\n\n  \n\n### **CAN-SPAM Act in the US**\n\nIn the United States, the CAN-SPAM Act sets the rules for commercial email. It establishes requirements for commercial messages, gives recipients the right to have you stop emailing them, and spells out tough penalties for violations. Key requirements include:\n\n  \n\n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    Not using false or misleading header information.\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    Not using deceptive subject lines.\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    Identifying the message as an ad.\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    Telling recipients where you’re located (physical postal address).\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    Telling recipients how to opt out of receiving future emails from you.\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    Honoring opt-out requests promptly.\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    Monitoring what others are doing on your behalf.\n    \n      \n    \n\n### **GDPR in Europe**\n\nThe General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) is even more stringent. It affects any business that processes the data of EU citizens, regardless of where the company is based. Under GDPR, you must have explicit consent to send emails, and the recipients have the right to access any data you have about them and the right to be forgotten. Key points include:\n\n  \n\n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    Obtaining clear consent to send emails.\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    Providing easy options for users to withdraw consent and unsubscribe.\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    Ensuring data is collected and processed lawfully.\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    Implementing appropriate security measures to protect personal data.\n    \n      \n    \n\n### **Ethical Considerations**\n\nBeyond legal compliance, ethical considerations should guide your campaign. This includes respecting privacy, being transparent about your intentions, and providing genuine value in your communications. Ethical practices not only help you avoid legal pitfalls but also build trust with your audience.\n\n  \n\n### **Cold Email Campaigns: Concluding Thoughts**\n\nImagine transforming your cold emails from mere messages into powerful conversation starters.

This isn’t just another email shot in the dark; it’s a well-researched, finely-tuned arrow hitting the bullseye of your prospective client’s attention. That’s the power of a cold email campaign when executed at scale.\n\n  \n\nYou might be thinking, “Isn’t cold emailing a numbers game?” While that is a common belief, times have changed. Today’s savvy sales professionals know it’s about much more than just volume. Cold email marketing strategy is about striking the right chord with the right message at the right time.\n\n  \n\nIn this comprehensive guide, we’re going to walk through the steps to set up a cold email campaign that doesn’t just reach out to a vast audience but engages them, speaks to their needs, and gets results.\n\n  \n\nWe’re not just talking about the same old techniques you’ve read a dozen times. We’re diving into lesser-known, innovative tactics that make your emails stand out in a crowded inbox.\n\n  \n\n**What Is Cold Emailing? Understanding Your Strategy**\n------------------------------------------------------\n\nSending a cold email sometimes feels like you’re just taking a wild guess and hoping for the best, but with the right strategy, it becomes a precision instrument in your marketing toolkit.\n\n  \n\nCold emailing is not just about sending out a mass of emails following typical sales templates. It’s about starting a conversation. Each email should be seen as an opening line in a dialogue with a potential client or partner.\n\n  \n\nAt its core, cold emailing is about connecting with another human being. Behind every email address is a person who is busy, discerning, and inundated with similar outreach efforts. Your email needs to cut through that noise by being relevant, respectful, and valuable.\n\n  \n\nA common problem with cold emails is that they focus too much on the sender and not enough on the recipient. To avoid this, frame your email around a problem that the recipient is likely facing and position your offering as the solution. The best cold email campaigns show that you understand their challenges and have done your homework.\n\n  \n\nAccording to a [2023 study by Saleshandy](https://outreachmonks.com/how-to-verify-email-addresses-and-improve-your-email-outreach-results/)\n, the average open rate for cold emails is around 24%. This highlights the importance of crafting an email that stands out and immediately presents value to the recipient.\n\n  \n![1](https://www.artisan.co/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.ctfassets.net%2Fkyprwggh4muz%2F1f8R2HIv76H7XWA1JOUgqy%2F0306940d409581899c838eee6a072623%2F1.png&w=3840&q=75)\n\n**Cold Email Campaigns: The Preparatory Work**\n----------------------------------------------\n\nBefore you can launch a successful cold email campaign, there’s a significant amount of groundwork that needs to be laid. This preparatory phase is where you set the foundation for your campaign’s success.\n\n  \n\n### **Identifying Your Target Audience**\n\nThe first step in any cold email campaign is to identify your recipient. This isn’t about casting a wide net and hoping for the best. The best cold email strategy comes down to precision targeting.\n\n  \n\nYou want to ensure that your message lands in the inbox of someone who has the authority and interest to engage with your offer.\n\n  \n\nTo truly revolutionize your sales strategy, meet [Ava, the Artisan Sales Rep](https://artisan.co/ava-sales-rep/)\n. Ava isn’t just another tool, she’s a transformative digital worker who takes lead discovery to a whole new level.\n\n  \n\nImagine having access to a staggering 265 million contacts and 65 unique data points at your fingertips. This is far beyond what traditional platforms like LinkedIn Sales Navigator offer.\n\n  \n![2](https://www.artisan.co/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.ctfassets.net%2Fkyprwggh4muz%2F1erA2U3yxRGAH0DMAXBZSL%2F8c1ac5495811dad5d057c1c5decbb2ae%2F2.png&w=3840&q=75)\n\nThis allows for precision targeting, ensuring your message lands in the inbox of someone who not only has authority but also a strong interest in engaging with your offer.\n\n  \n![3](https://www.artisan.co/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.ctfassets.net%2Fkyprwggh4muz%2F5By8AqFGFNuzv1NS6uoLlh%2Fda2e0fca10dfe968aa435f40e76c1d8e%2F3.jpeg&w=3840&q=75)\n\nPrecision targeting creates a list of individuals most likely to benefit from your product or service. You’re not merely finding any contact within a company. You’re finding the decision-makers, the influencers, and the champions who can drive action.\n\n  \n\n### **Building a Quality Cold Email Campaign Contact List**\n\nOnce you’ve identified your target audience, the next step is to build a contact list – and not just any list, but a quality list! This is where many cold email campaigns falter. They prioritize quantity over quality, leading to high bounce rates and low engagement.\n\n  \n\nThe solution?\n\n  \n\nCold email campaign software like Hunter.io. Not only does Hunter.io help you find email addresses, but it also verifies them. This is a critical step in maintaining a high sender reputation. Ava also comes equipped to help your company craft a good cold email list, with millions of potential contacts built-in from the get-go.\n\n  \n![4](https://www.artisan.co/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.ctfassets.net%2Fkyprwggh4muz%2F2JqUstBeA4oQu5pShJKbAh%2F787b434b448403f8cfb8017c53bcde2f%2F4.png&w=3840&q=75)\n\nAccording to a [2023 report by outreachmonks](https://outreachmonks.com/how-to-verify-email-addresses-and-improve-your-email-outreach-results/)\n, verified email campaigns experience a significant drop in bounce rates, amounting to 90%. This statistic underscores the importance of email verification in ensuring your messages reach their intended recipients.\n\n  \n![5](https://www.artisan.co/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.ctfassets.net%2Fkyprwggh4muz%2F60oGwW9HmBGSqZSKRDyQyS%2F0016d8b0b03221dd5730d849f63c6e9e%2F5.png&w=3840&q=75)\n\n### **Crafting Your Value Proposition**\n\nYour value proposition is the core of your cold email campaign. It’s the reason why the recipient should care about what you have to say.\n\n  \n\nTo craft a compelling value proposition, you need to understand what’s currently relevant in your industry. This is where Google Trends can be an invaluable resource. By showing you what’s trending, you can align your value proposition with the interests and needs of your prospects.\n\n  \n![6](https://www.artisan.co/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.ctfassets.net%2Fkyprwggh4muz%2F7rXKGs5bE2FFGA9VDCY8wX%2F691eeb796b6f01173a84ab740770d01f%2F6.png&w=3840&q=75)\n\nSales Rep Artisan’s Ava also shines here. She not only addresses but actively solves key problems in outbound sales.\n\n  \n\nAva, with her unique touch, crafts personalized email sequences that reach out to thousands of your prospects. Each email is carefully designed to resonate with the individual needs and concerns of every recipient.\n\n  \n\nThis approach not only brings your value proposition into the spotlight but also makes it more relatable and impactful.\n\n  \n\nIt’s not just about what you offer but about what your offer does for the potential customer. How does your product or service make their life easier? How does it solve a pain point? That’s what your value proposition should convey.\n\n  \n\n**Writing Cold Email**s for Your Campaign\n-----------------------------------------\n\nCrafting an effective cold email is an art that balances brevity with persuasion. It’s about making an immediate impact with words that are both engaging and respectful of the recipient’s time.\n\n  \n\nHere’s how to ensure your cold email stands out and prompts a response.\n\n  \n\n### **The Subject Line**\n\nThe subject line is your first and often only chance to make an impression in a cold email campaign. It should be a beacon in a sea of emails, compelling enough to prompt an open, yet honest enough to set realistic expectations for what’s inside.\n\n  \n\nAccording to a 2023 report by Mailmunch, the [average email open rate](https://www.mailmunch.com/blog/email-open-rate)\n across all industries is 21.33%. This statistic highlights the challenge and importance of crafting a subject line that stands out.\n\n  \n\nTo achieve this, use actionable language that conveys urgency or benefit. For instance, “Unlock X% more efficiency with our tool” is direct and suggests a clear advantage. Avoid generic phrases like “monthly newsletter” or “just checking in,” which are easily overlooked.\n\n  \n![7](https://www.artisan.co/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.ctfassets.net%2Fkyprwggh4muz%2FYsrnP2aBErVify4ExEexG%2F4fadead94e4d705fac54300fcf6c60b2%2F7.png&w=3840&q=75)\n\n### **The Email Body**\n\nThe body of your email is where you make your pitch, but remember the human behind the screen. This is not a monologue. It’s the start of a conversation.\n\n  \n\nThe key is to be concise but powerful. Focus on how you can help the recipient, not just on what you’re offering.\n\n  \n\nBegin with a personalized greeting to establish a connection. Then, succinctly state the problem you’ve identified that pertains to their business.\n\n  \n\nFollow this with your value proposition: a solution that’s not just beneficial but tailored to their specific needs. Use bullet points or short paragraphs to keep the content digestible.\n\n  \n\nTools like Grammarly and Hemingway Editor can ensure your writing is clear, concise, and free of errors, which is essential when you have only a few sentences to make your case.\n\n  \n![8](https://www.artisan.co/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.ctfassets.net%2Fkyprwggh4muz%2F7JKtJOFgDjV4CBozX9nqIg%2F85932d6a8478310a35ef1cacf053b40c%2F8.png&w=3840&q=75)\n\n### **The Call-to-Action**\n\nThe call-to-action (CTA) is the culmination of your cold email. It should be a natural next step for the reader, whether it’s to schedule a call, download a whitepaper, or simply reply for more information.\n\n  \n\nMake it as frictionless as possible. For instance, embed a link to a scheduling tool like [Calendly](https://calendly.com/)\n to remove barriers to booking a meeting.\n\n  \n\nYour CTA should be clear and direct, avoiding any ambiguity about what you want the recipient to do next. Phrases like “Let’s talk” or “See how with a free demo” are more inviting and less aggressive than “Buy now” or “Sign up today.”\n\n  \n![14](https://www.artisan.co/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.ctfassets.net%2Fkyprwggh4muz%2F1aMjT3XlmtVBg4Z8oCIPSW%2F645f40e80b67ec5adb3195061d2a4f33%2F14.png&w=3840&q=75)\n\nRemember, the goal of a cold email is not necessarily to close a sale but to initiate a dialogue. By crafting a subject line that piques interest, an email body that speaks directly to the recipient’s needs, and a CTA that guides them towards the next step, you set the stage for a productive conversation that could lead to a valuable business relationship.\n\n  \n\n**The Cold Email Campaign Technical Setup**\n-------------------------------------------\n\nSetting up a cold email campaign involves more than just crafting compelling content. It’s also about ensuring that your emails actually reach the inbox. This is where the technical setup comes into play, and it’s a step you can’t afford to overlook. Determining the best cold email software and tools for your campaign are crucial to success.\n\n  \n\nLet’s have a peek into the intricacies of this process.\n\n  \n\n### **Email Automation and Tracking Tools**\n\nEmail automation tools are the engines that power large-scale cold email campaigns. Platforms like Mailchimp are renowned for their user-friendly automation workflows, which allow you to send out emails based on triggers and schedules you define.\n\n  \n![9](https://www.artisan.co/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.ctfassets.net%2Fkyprwggh4muz%2F7kVzQQKhyns2r4MU8yZCwI%2F1f90a224a383b60f113edb8610b3f68b%2F9.png&w=3840&q=75)\n\nThis helps ensure that your emails are sent at the optimal time for engagement.\n\n  \n\nOn the other hand, SendGrid offers robust scalability for larger campaigns, making it a go-to for businesses that need to send out a high volume of emails without sacrificing deliverability.\n\n  \n\nTracking is another critical component of your technical setup. Tools like Yesware and Mailtrack provide valuable insights into open and click rates, which are vital for understanding how recipients are engaging with your emails.\n\n  \n![10](https://www.artisan.co/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.ctfassets.net%2Fkyprwggh4muz%2F1xnbdI7YJK22PWBUmxak9p%2F36bef0f896984c0df7c3529cdba6671f%2F10.png&w=3840&q=75)\n\nThis data is vital for refining your approach and improving the effectiveness of your campaigns.\n\n  \n\n### **Ensuring Deliverability**\n\nDeliverability is the cornerstone of a successful cold email campaign. If your emails don’t reach the inbox, nothing else matters.\n\n  \n\nThis is where MXToolbox comes in. It’s a comprehensive tool that checks your domain against blacklists and helps monitor the health of your email server.\n\n  \n\nKeeping your domain off blacklists and ensuring your server is running smoothly are essential for maintaining high deliverability rates.\n\n  \n\nA recent [2023 Email Deliverability Benchmark Report by Validity](https://www.validity.com/resource-center/2023-email-deliverability-benchmark-report/)\n revealed that 1 in 10 emails are not accepted by receiving mailbox providers. The report also highlighted that deliverability at major global mailbox providers like Microsoft, AOL, Gmail, and Yahoo is 86%, which is higher than the global average.\n\n  \n\nThis underscores the importance of monitoring deliverability metrics and taking proactive steps to address any issues.\n\n  \n\n**Scaling Your Cold Email Campaign**\n------------------------------------\n\nScaling a cold email campaign effectively requires a delicate balance between personalization and automation.\n\n  \n\nThe challenge lies in maintaining the feel of one-on-one communication while reaching hundreds or thousands of prospects.\n\n  \n\nThis is where Sales Rep Artisan’s Ava becomes invaluable. Imagine a tool so powerful that it effortlessly scales with your growing needs, managing thousands of prospects each month.\n\n  \n\nWhether you’re just starting out or expanding rapidly, Ava adapts seamlessly, offering plans that range from handling 50 prospects to an unlimited number.\n\n  \n\nWith Ava, you’re not just running a campaign; you’re building a community. And the best part? You can do all this without relying on a myriad of third-party tools. Ava is your all-in-one solution, simplifying your campaign management with a user-friendly approach, free from complicated jargon.\n\n  \n\nWhether you choose the Free, Gold, Platinum, or Enterprise package, Ava adapts to your scaling needs without losing the personal touch.\n\n  \n\nOn the other hand, personalizing each email is time-consuming and not feasible at scale. The solution is to find the right mix of automation and personal touch.\n\n  \n\n### **Automating the Process**\n\nTools like [Outreach](https://www.outreach.io/)\n and [Salesloft](https://help.salesloft.com/s/?language=en_US)\n offer sophisticated automation options that can send emails based on recipient behavior. For instance, if a recipient opens an email but doesn’t click any links, they can be automatically sent a follow-up email with a more direct call to action.\n\n  \n\nLet’s look at an example from a case study. A B2B analytics and data provider wanted to scale their cold outreach email . They used [InboxAlly](https://www.inboxally.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Case-Study-Cold-Emailing.pdf)\n to warm up a new domain and start sending 1,000 to 2,000 cold emails per day. By leveraging automation and personalization, they saw a significant increase in their open and reply rates, demonstrating the effectiveness of a balanced approach.\n\n  \n\n### **A/B Testing**\n\nA/B testing is crucial for understanding what resonates with your audience. By testing different subject lines, email copy, and CTAs, you can refine your approach.\n\n  \n\nGoogle Analytics can be integrated with your email platform to track which variations perform best, allowing you to optimize future campaigns.\n\n  \n![11](https://www.artisan.co/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.ctfassets.net%2Fkyprwggh4muz%2F0g0BKZBbVaOYPB8yKud3E%2Fdf072a234573d79c2a05720630acfff5%2F11.png&w=3840&q=75)\n\n### **Analyzing and Acting on Data**\n\nThe data from your email platform will provide insights into open rates, click-through rates, and conversion rates.\n\n  \n\nBy analyzing this data, you can identify trends and patterns, such as the best times to send emails or the most effective messaging for different segments of your audience. This can help you continually improve and optimize your cold email campaign.\n\n  \n\n**Advanced Cold Email Strategies**\n----------------------------------\n\nWhen it comes to cold emailing, the magic is in the details. Advanced strategies in personalization and leveraging social proof can significantly enhance the effectiveness of your campaign.\n\n  \n\nHere’s how to incorporate these tactics at scale.\n\n  \n\n### **Personalization at Scale**\n\nThe challenge with personalization at scale is maintaining the efficiency of your campaign while ensuring each cold email feels unique and tailored to the recipient. Generic emails are easy to spot and often ignored, but crafting individual emails for thousands of prospects is not feasible.\n\n  \n\nHubSpot’s personalization tokens are a game-changer for scaling your cold email strategy. These tokens allow you to insert specific details about each recipient into your emails automatically.\n\n  \n\nAva can help automate personalization, ghostwriting individualized emails with AI on behalf of your team. Ava also optimizes her approach over time as she learns organically how to best interact with potential leads.\n\n  \n![12](https://www.artisan.co/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.ctfassets.net%2Fkyprwggh4muz%2FBOHgJPTUgBtGfbHPd4eqa%2F247bfbe4dd26d604c98bbeb8a21eac2f%2F12.png&w=3840&q=75)\n\nFor example, you can address recipients by their first name, mention their company, or reference a recent interaction they had with your content.\n\n  \n\nAirbnb’s email marketing campaigns are a testament to the power of personalization. They use customer data to send personalized recommendations and updates, making each communication feel bespoke.\n\n  \n\nFor instance, they might send an email featuring rental options in a city a customer has searched for, along with activities in that area. This level of personalization at scale has been crucial to Airbnb’s customer engagement strategy.\n\n  \n\n### **Using Social Proof**\n\nIncorporating testimonials and user reviews in your emails can significantly boost credibility and trust. Testimonial.to is a platform that allows you to seamlessly integrate social proof into your emails.\n\n  \n![13](https://www.artisan.co/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.ctfassets.net%2Fkyprwggh4muz%2F7jy4JV602AuOAcGJeyZbIj%2F5884040bd05f7c85ceac70a68dbaf8ba%2F13.png&w=3840&q=75)\n\nBy showing prospects that others have had success with your product or service, you can increase the persuasive power of your cold email campaign.\n\n  \n\n### **Following Up**\n\nTiming is everything in follow-ups. [Boomerang for Gmail](https://www.boomeranggmail.com/)\n allows you to schedule your follow-up emails at the optimal time, increasing the likelihood of a response. This tool can also remind you to follow up if you don’t receive a reply within a certain timeframe.\n\n  \n\n**Cold Email Legal and Ethical Considerations**\n-----------------------------------------------\n\nWhen scaling cold email campaigns, it’s not just about the strategies and tools you use to achieve success; it’s also about navigating the complex landscape of legal and ethical considerations. Here’s a detailed look at what you need to keep in mind.\n\n  \n\nThe primary challenge in this area is ensuring that your cold email campaign complies with various laws and regulations, which can vary significantly by country or region. Non-compliance can result in severe penalties, including fines and damage to your company’s reputation.\n\n  \n\nNow let’s have a look at some of the solutions.\n\n  \n\n### **CAN-SPAM Act in the US**\n\nIn the United States, the CAN-SPAM Act sets the rules for commercial email. It establishes requirements for commercial messages, gives recipients the right to have you stop emailing them, and spells out tough penalties for violations. Key requirements include:\n\n  \n\n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    Not using false or misleading header information.\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    Not using deceptive subject lines.\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    Identifying the message as an ad.\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    Telling recipients where you’re located (physical postal address).\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    Telling recipients how to opt out of receiving future emails from you.\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    Honoring opt-out requests promptly.\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    Monitoring what others are doing on your behalf.\n    \n      \n    \n\n### **GDPR in Europe**\n\nThe General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) is even more stringent. It affects any business that processes the data of EU citizens, regardless of where the company is based. Under GDPR, you must have explicit consent to send emails, and the recipients have the right to access any data you have about them and the right to be forgotten. Key points include:\n\n  \n\n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    Obtaining clear consent to send emails.\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    Providing easy options for users to withdraw consent and unsubscribe.\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    Ensuring data is collected and processed lawfully.\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    Implementing appropriate security measures to protect personal data.\n    \n      \n    \n\n### **Ethical Considerations**\n\nBeyond legal compliance, ethical considerations should guide your campaign. This includes respecting privacy, being transparent about your intentions, and providing genuine value in your communications. Ethical practices not only help you avoid legal pitfalls but also build trust with your audience.\n\n  \n\n### **Cold Email Campaigns: Concluding Thoughts**\n\nImagine transforming your cold emails from mere messages into powerful conversation starters.

It is research-backed action plan highlighting your goals and how to achieve them.\n\n  \n\nIn the world of B2B and SaaS especially, product launches are an uphill battle. Due to factors like inflation and market instability, companies are becoming increasingly economical with their budgets in 2024. Getting a business to invest in your product or service takes a lot of convincing. You’ll need to enter the game ready to illustrate how you’re uniquely qualified to help companies thrive.\n\n  \n\nIf you’re struggling with where to start, consider this your 2024 guide to building a top-notch B2B go-to-market strategy.\n\n  \n\nWhat Is A B2B Go-To-Market Strategy?\n------------------------------------\n\nYour B2B go-to-market (GTM) strategy is your roadmap. It’s a comprehensive plan that outlines how your company will introduce and deliver its products or services to the market, attract customers, and achieve a competitive advantage. According to Gartner, a GTM strategy [answers two questions](https://www.gartner.com/en/digital-markets/insights/what-is-go-to-market-strategy)\n – who and how? That is, who is the ideal target for your product or service and how can you best engage them?\n\n  \n\nHow Are SaaS B2B Go-To-Market Strategies Unique?\n------------------------------------------------\n\nWhen it comes to SaaS, there are some unique factors to consider when hashing out your B2B go-to-market strategy, including:\n\n  \n\n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Subscription Models:** As SaaS products typically focus on subscription-based pricing models, you can spend more time and money acquiring customers as they have higher lifetime values.\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Online Distribution and Sales:** Your website is crucial when it comes to SaaS sales. Plan to optimize your sales funnel and leverage appropriate digital marketing channels.\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Scalability:** As SaaS products can be delivered globally with minimal additional cost, make sure your B2B GTM strategy addresses how you plan to scale.\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Customer Support:** This is absolutely critical for SaaS success, so make sure your team has a clearcut plan to provide excellent customer service such as live chat, knowledge bases, [AI customer support](/ai-sales-agent)\n    , and ticketing systems.\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Data Security and SOC2 Compliance:** Building trust is essential when dealing with sensitive customer data. Make sure you not only have a plan for data privacy and security but that you communicate that plan clearly to potential customers. This includes Service Organization Control Type 2 (SOC2) compliance, which is usually required for enterprise customers.\n    \n      \n    \n\n  \nAdditionally, with B2B go-to-market strategies, you’re targeting other businesses. Sales reps and CEOs are more than familiar with typical marketing strategies, and therefore more likely to be skeptical. A clear understanding of your target customers, their pain points, and the solutions your service provides is paramount.\n\n  \n\nB2B Go-To-Market Strategy: 5 Key Steps\n--------------------------------------\n\n### 1\\. Brand Design & Positioning\n\nA B2B go-to-market strategy starts with defining your brand. Branding and positioning help you set yourself apart from competitors and refine your messaging to best communicate with potential customers.\n\n  \n\n#### Understand Your Target Audience\n\nWhen you’re determining who your product is for, you need to look at two factors: the buying center _and_ the buying personas.\n\n  \n\nEstimates range, but expect between [7 and 20 individuals on average](https://www.colonyspark.com/blog/questions-for-b2b-buying-committee/)\n to be involved in the B2B sales process. This makes up your buying center. These individuals play various roles and have different responsibilities, perspectives, and interests. Key roles within a buying center include:\n\n  \n\n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Initiator:** The person or group that recognizes a need for a product or service within the organization and initiates the buying process.\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Influencer:** Individuals or groups that can influence the purchasing decision by providing information, opinions, or recommendations.\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Decider:** The person or group with the authority to make the final decision on whether to proceed with the purchase.\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Buyer:** The individual or group responsible for negotiating and finalizing the terms of the purchase.\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **User:** Individuals or departments that will use the product or service once it’s purchased.\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Gatekeeper:** An individual or group that controls the flow of information to the buying center.\n    \n      \n    \n\n  \nOnce you’ve identified your buying center, focus on the individual roles within that center. Are your initiators sales representatives? IT professionals? Part of the customer service team? What about your influencers? Your users? These titles help you create detailed buyer personas.\n\n  \n\nDetailed buyer personas are generalized representations of ideal customers based on market research. These personas help your company understand and empathize with the different segments of your target audience, which brings us to our next step.\n\n  \n\n#### Create Value Matrixes\n\nA value matrix, often used in business and marketing, is a visual representation that helps businesses assess and compare the value of different options or choices based on specific criteria. This matrix is useful for evaluating products, services, or features in relation to the needs and priorities of customers or stakeholders.\n\n  \n\nFor example, a value matrix might identify a user persona, their pain points, the product value proposition, and the appropriate messaging to attract this specific customer.\n\n  \n\nSay your buyer persona is a sales rep struggling to manage a high amount of calls toward the end of year. One of your product’s key features is that it automates booking meetings. Messages that might appeal to this buyer include “We’ll manage your calendar so you don’t have to!” and “Focus on meeting prep. We’ll handle the booking.”\n\n  \n\n#### Define Your Brand Messaging\n\nEstablishing clear brand messaging prior to launch helps you enter the market prepared to articulate the value of your product or service. Determine the following:\n\n  \n\n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Your mission statement** is a concise declaration of your company’s purpose that outlines the reason it exists. It explains your company’s core values, goals, and the primary stakeholders. It answers the question, “Why was this company founded?”\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Your value proposition** communicates the unique value and benefits that your product or service provides. It answers the question, “Why should I choose this product or service over others?”\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Your brand proposition** refers to the unique identity and positioning of a brand in the marketplace. It’s a broader concept than your value proposition that goes beyond a specific product or service. It answers the question, “Why should I trust _this specific company_?”\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Your Unique Selling Proposition (USP)** is a distinctive aspect of a product or service that sets it apart from competitors. It highlights unique features that address a key customer need or pain point. Think of this as your company’s niche. It answers the question, “What makes this business different from similar brands?”\n    \n      \n    \n\n#### Determine Your Pricing Model\n\nWith the SaaS/B2B sales cycle, your pricing model will typically fall into the following categories:\n\n  \n\n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Freemium:** A free plan with limited features with the goal of customers eventually upgrading to a paid plan.\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Flat Rate:** Your product or service is accessible to all users at a monthly fixed rate with no extra fees for certain features.\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **User-based:** The cost of a product or service is determined by the number of users.\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Pricing per feature:** Subscription costs are determined by the number of features a company needs.\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Tiered Pricing:** Multiple packages offering a mix of different features at varying prices.\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Pay-As-You-Go:** Users get charged based on how often they use a product.\n    \n      \n    \n\n  \nThe right pricing model for your company is highly contingent on your product or service, revenue goals, and target market. We recommend A/B testing during your first few months operating to determine which model attracts the most long-term customers.\n\n  \n\n#### Conduct Competitive Analysis\n\nComprehensive competitive analysis is crucial for developing a robust B2B go-to-market strategy. Competitive analysis helps you understand the current landscape, identify strengths and weaknesses of competitors, and determine how your service can differentiate itself.\n\n  \n\nKey components of competitive analysis include:\n\n  \n\n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Identify your competitors:** List direct and indirect competitors in your industry considering traditional and new market entrants as well as global, national, and local competitors.\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Evaluate product/service offerings**: Understand the products or services offered by each of these competitors and analyze their features, functionalities, pricing models, and unique selling points.\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Review market share and positioning:** Analyze how competitors position themselves in the market and identify any key differentiators and value propositions. This helps you see which gaps in the market need to be filled.\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Study customer segmentation:** Analyze the target customer segments of each competitor to look for potential overlap as well as the needs and preferences of major customer demographics in your industry. Again, look for gaps here. This helps you find your niche.\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Research marketing and promotion:** Check out how competitors market and promote their products and analyze the impact of these tactics. Identify key messaging and look for any unanswered questions that your content can answer.\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Conduct SWOT analysis:** A SWOT (Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, Threats) analysis for each competitor helps you identify internal and external factors affecting their competitiveness.\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Read customer reviews and feedback:** Customer reviews and feedback help you understand customer satisfaction and pain points and identify areas where you have a competitive advantage.\n    \n      \n    \n\n### 2\\. Awareness\n\nOnce you have a thorough understanding of your brand, you’ll be ready to plan your awareness campaign. Awareness focuses on top-of-the-funnel marketing. Here, you will combine paid and organic channels to build initial awareness with potential users building up to your launch.\n\n  \n\n#### Content Marketing\n\nWhen it comes to B2B go-to-market strategies, content marketing is your bread and butter. You can expect a lot of inbound leads initially, so excellent content to snag curious customers is key.\n\n  \n\nHowever, this is easier said than done. These days, people are inundated with content on a daily basis. Type any question into Google and the top-ranking results are bound to be company blogs. A good B2B go-to-market strategy will help your company snag one of these coveted spots, but simply getting leads to click is but a fraction of the battle. You need content that builds trust in your brand.\n\n  \n\nThorough keyword research gives you a good sense of where to start in terms of trending topics, but SEO-optimized blogs in and of themselves won’t do much if the writing isn’t quality. Top-of-funnel content avoids the hardsell. Instead, you’re creating genuinely informative, educational material to establish yourself as an industry authority. Focus on blog posts, ebooks, white papers, and more that strive to address common customer questions and pain points.\n\n  \n\nWe also recommend creating video content. Videos catch customers’ attention fast and are therefore a way to quickly boost brand authority. Product tutorials or brief, educational videos on YouTube can help, as can an active presence on apps like TikTok. Remember, the goal is to provide genuinely helpful information to your target demographic. Try a simple video tutorial on creating good prompts for language learning models, for example.\n\n  \n\nWhen hashing out a content marketing plan, remember what you learned during competitive analysis – look for gaps in existing content. If there’s not a single decent blog post answering the question, “What is the difference between a [digital worker](/blogs/beyond-bots-your-2024-guide-to-digital-workers)\n and a chatbot?” then congratulations! You found the focal point of your next company blog!\n\n  \n\n#### Social Media\n\nSocial media is where you’ll share all your content, but your online presence should be more than just links to your own website. Focus on becoming a brand leader in online spaces.\n\n  \n\nLinkedIn marketing is a great option for a B2B go-to-market Strategy. Long-form LinkedIn posts broadly discussing industry trends help you connect with like-minded individuals and potential customers and begin to establish yourself as an industry authority.\n\n  \n\nHowever, there are other, less conventional outlets that are gaining steam in the B2B space. Start popping on Quora Answers to join in on conversations related to your field. Develop an active presence on Reddit subs like r/sales and r/entrepreneur to talk up your brand, show off your industry knowledge, and create some hype for your upcoming launch.\n\n  \n\nInfluencer marketing is a powerful component of social media strategy. If it’s within your budget, we highly recommend partnering with relevant influencers in your field. Influencers have built-in trust with existing consumers, which grants you immediate access to a massive network.\n\n  \n\n#### Paid Content\n\nAny Google user knows that the first few hits you see when you search a topic are sponsored content. To stand out, you’ll need to allocate some of your budget into paid ad campaigns, content, articles, sponsorships, and more. Consider some of the following:\n\n  \n\n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Social Media Advertising:** Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter ads based on your target demographics’ interests, and behavior.\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Search Engine Advertising:** Google or Bing ads that display in the search result based on keywords relevant to your brand.\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Video Advertising:** Ads that run before, during, or in-between videos on platforms like YouTube and TikTok.\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Sponsored Content:** Pay for articles on popular online publications related to your industry.\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Podcast Advertising:** Sponsor specific episodes or segments of popular podcasts or pay podcast hosts to read and endorse your brand during the show.\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Mobile Advertising:** In-app display ads within mobile applications relevant to your target audience or short video ads optimized for mobile viewing.\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Sponsorships:** Sponsor industry events, conferences, or local community events.\n    \n      \n    \n\n### 3\\. Activation\n\nOnce you have a solid number of potential customers intrigued, it’s time to activate your market. Instead of casting a wide net, activation allocates resources toward those customers most likely to convert and have a high lifetime value.\n\n  \n\n#### Identify Customer Online Behavior\n\n##### Gather Behavioral Data\n\nBehavioral data helps you predict customer behavior throughout the buying journey. Brands employ various strategies to collect behavioral data, leveraging digital technologies to gain insights into consumer preferences and habits.\n\n  \n\nOnline platforms, such as websites and mobile applications, utilize cookies and tracking pixels to monitor users’ browsing behavior, tracking pages visited, time spent, interactions, and so on. Social media platforms analyze user engagement, likes, shares, and comments. Additionally, you can tap into third-party data sources and employ data analytics tools to interpret the collected information.\n\n  \n\n##### Determine the Most Effective Channels\n\nYour B2B go-to-market strategy should have a plan to identify and target the most effective channels for customer outreach. By the time you reach the activation phase, you’ll already have done some of the legwork. Market research and buyer personas identify where your target audience spends time online and how they prefer to consume information.\n\n  \n\nBehavioral data helps you refine your approach even more. Data analytics help you track and evaluate the performance of different channels. Continuous testing and optimization ensures you invest resources in the channels that resonate most effectively with your audience.\n\n  \n\n#### Retarget Potential Customers with Ads\n\nRetargeted ads focus on customers who have already visited your website and shown interest in your product or service. These highly personalized ads target consumers where they already hang out online.\n\n  \n\nCompanies often use Google ads and social media ads on relevant websites like LinkedIn, Meta, Reddit, and X. Retargeted ads focus on a more personalized experience applicable to a specific customer’s interests. Maybe you’re referencing a page they visited or offering a discount on a subscription model they viewed. Retargeted ads remind potential customers that your product or service is ready and waiting for their purchase, but the appeal goes beyond keeping your company on the forefront of consumers’ minds.\n\n  \n\nRetargeted ads show potential customers you’re in tune with what they want. According to [Salesforce Research](https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbesbusinesscouncil/2022/03/11/what-does-todays-consumer-want-personalized-seamless-omnichannel-experiences/?sh=5589e67b1e1e)\n, 66% of customers expect companies to understand their individual needs and 52% expect personalized offers.\n\n  \n\n#### Create Email Lists\n\nYou can snag customer emails in a variety of fashions from opt-in subscriptions to webinars and events to content downloads. Keep lists of customer emails segmented based on interests and needs to create personalized campaigns tailored to individual customers.\n\n  \n\nEmails worth sending during the activation phase include:\n\n  \n\n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Welcoming New Subscribers**: A nice welcome email improves the customer experience and provides useful information about your product or service.\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Personalized Emails:** If a customer, say, was considering a particular subscription model, shoot them a personalized email advertising the benefits and drawbacks of that model to help them make an informed purchasing decision.\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Exclusive Offers/Discounts:** If a customer lingered over a particular product, offer them an individualized discount to maximize their likelihood of converting.\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Newsletters and Brand Updates:** Keep customers in the know about your industry and brand with informative newsletters that provide relevant, useful information.\n    \n      \n    \n      \n    \n\n### 4\\. Revenue\n\nYour B2B go-to-market strategy should include a long-term plan to maximize average revenue per user (ARPU). Remember, getting customers to sign up is only the beginning; you’ll need to focus on both retaining those customers and getting them to continually upgrade.\n\n  \n\n#### Identify Key Metrics\n\nA few metrics worth tracking include:\n\n  \n\n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Monthly or Annual ARPU:** The average revenue per user on a monthly or annual basis provides an overall view of customer spending over an extended period.\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Customer Lifetime Value (CLV):** CLV estimates the total revenue a business can expect from a customer throughout their entire relationship. It’s a forward-looking metric that helps in long-term planning.\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Churn Rate:** Churn rate measures the percentage of customers who stop using your product or service over a given period. A lower churn rate contributes positively to long-term ARPU.\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Expansion Revenue:** Track revenue generated from existing customers through upsells, cross-sells, or additional services. This represents the ability to grow revenue from your current customer base.\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Retention Rate:** Retention rate indicates the percentage of customers retained over a specific period. A high retention rate positively impacts long-term ARPU by keeping customers engaged.\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Customer Engagement Metrics:** Track customer engagement metrics such as active usage, time spent on your platform, or frequency of interactions. Engaged customers are more likely to contribute to long-term ARPU.\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Average Transaction Value:** Analyze the average value of individual transactions. Understanding how much customers spend in each transaction helps in predicting long-term revenue potential.\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Customer Satisfaction (CSAT) and Net Promoter Score (NPS):** Satisfied customers are more likely to remain loyal. Monitoring customer satisfaction and NPS can provide insights into customer sentiment, impacting long-term ARPU.\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Product Adoption Rates:** Monitor how quickly customers adopt new features or products. Higher adoption rates can lead to increased usage and higher long-term ARPU.\n    \n      \n    \n\n#### Focus On Customer Experience\n\nQuality customer experience is vital for increasing ARPU. Good customer experience starts from the very beginning with a thorough onboarding process. Make sure customers know how to use your product and how to get help when needed. A talented customer service team, AI support, and a variety of tutorial materials are crucial for good onboarding.\n\n  \n\nOnce a customer is onboarded, have a plan to ensure a good long-term experience. Some useful tips include:\n\n  \n\n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Solicit regular feedback:** Customers want to be heard. Regular feedback not only helps your customers feel valued, but it helps your company identify and correct any weak spots.\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Take complaints seriously:** This is where investing in empathetic, experienced customer service reps is important. Treating customer complaints with sincere concern helps consumers feel respected, encouraging them to stick around in the long run.\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Monitor customer behavior:** Keep an eye on how customers use your product and which features are most popular. As you upgrade your services, you’ll know where to direct the most energy.\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Plan for continual improvement:** Obsolescence happens fast in software development, so you’ll need a long-term plan to keep your service updated regularly to stay in tune with all the latest industry trends and consumer needs.\n    \n      \n    \n\n#### Encourage Upgrades\n\nThe best way to encourage customer upgrades is to provide a stellar experience that leaves customers wanting more. However, there are some tactics you can employ to speed the upgrade process along.\n\n  \n\nFirst, timing is key. The most effective time to ask for an upgrade is when a customer is already in buyer mode, so offer upgrade options at checkout based on that customers’ specific purchases or subscription model. Not every customer will bite, but it’ll plant a seed for potential upgrades later on.\n\n  \n\nSecond, remember that consumers crave a personal experience. Track how your customers use your product or service and create upgrade options tailored to what would be most useful to them.\n\n  \n\nThird, a little taste can entice customers to take the plunge. Try unlocking new features for free temporarily or offering free upgrade trials to long-term customers. Customers who would otherwise be wary to throw money down immediately may be more likely to upgrade if they can test out new features first.\n\n  \n\n### 5\\. Virality\n\nWhen you’re launching a new product or service, word of mouth is crucial. A good B2B go-to-market strategy should plan to incentivize customers to talk up your product.\n\n  \n\n#### Shareable Marketing Campaigns\n\nIf you’re on social media, around late November you probably start seeing friends share their Spotify Wrapped list, detailing the songs and genres they listened to most that year. Spotify Wrapped remains an ingenious marketing campaign as it gives users something fun and personalized that they get excited about posting.\n\n  \n\nSo, what’s your Spotify Wrapped? Brainstorming some shareable marketing campaigns prior to your launch sets you up for success. After your product has made a splash for a few months, you’ll have a plan in place to get customers talking.\n\n  \n\nFor example, maybe you’re rolling out an AI assistant that helps with company tasks ranging from data entry to scheduling meetings to managing customer inquiries. A good end-of-year campaign could be providing companies with metrics like the number of meetings booked, the number of customer complaints resolved, the number of employee hours saved, and so on. This is the kind of personalized content that users genuinely enjoy sharing.\n\n  \n\n#### Encourage Reviews\n\nAccording to Gartner, [86% of software buyers](https://www.gartner.com/en/digital-markets/insights/what-is-go-to-market-strategy)\n consider verified customer reviews a vital part of the buying process. For a B2B go-to-market strategy, you’ll need a plan to encourage customer reviews.\n\n  \n\nAs with asking for upgrades, timing matters. Ask for reviews at the right time, preferably when the customer has recently experienced a positive interaction or achieved a successful outcome with your product or service.\n\n  \n\nOther ways to encourage reviews include:\n\n  \n\n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Email Campaigns:** Implement email campaigns to request reviews including direct links to your review platforms.\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Thank-You Pages:** After a purchase or a positive interaction, redirect customers to a thank-you page that includes a request for a review.\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Social Media:** Share success stories, and directly ask your followers to share their experiences on review platforms.\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Personalize Requests:** Personalize your review requests by mentioning specific interactions or purchases. This shows customers that their individual experiences matter.\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Respond to Existing Reviews:** Engage with existing reviews by responding to them, whether they are positive or negative. This demonstrates that you value customer feedback and may encourage others to share their experiences.\n    \n      \n    \n\n#### Referrals and Affiliate Programs\n\nReferral and affiliate programs are great ways to encourage customers to spread the word about your product. Consider employing both in your B2B GTM strategy.\n\n  \n\n##### Referral Programs\n\nReferral programs encourage existing customers to recommend a product or service to their friends, family, or colleagues. A business establishes a referral program with clear incentives. Existing customers receive a referral link or code and advocates share this link or code with others. When a new customer makes a purchase using the referral link or code, the advocate receives the predetermined incentive.\n\n  \n\nReferrals help build personal relationships and trust, tap into customers’ existing networks, and are cost-effective compared to other acquisition methods.\n\n  \n\n##### Affiliate Programs\n\nAffiliate programs involve partnering with external individuals or entities (affiliates) who promote a product or service in exchange for a commission for each sale or lead generated. Affiliates sign up and receive unique affiliate links or tracking codes and then promote the product or service through various channels. When a sale or lead is generated through an affiliate’s efforts, they earn a commission.\n\n  \n\nAffiliate programs expand reach by leveraging a network of affiliates, attracting professional marketers and influencers, and providing a scalable model for driving sales.\n\n  \n\nThe Bottom Line\n---------------\n\nCreating a B2B go-to-market strategy can be daunting, but it’s ultimately worth the effort. An already tough playing field is going to become more and more competitive in 2024, especially with so many new players entering the SaaS game. Before launching, understanding your target audience and learning the most effective means to communicate with them will set you apart in an oversaturated market.\n\n  \n\nShare Article\n\n![copy-link](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/copy-link.svg)[![copy-link](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/mail.svg)](mailto:?body=https://www.artisan.co/blog/your-2024-b2b-go-to-market-strategy-a-comprehensive-guide-for-saas-companies)\n\nYou might also like\n-------------------\n\nReady to Supercharge Your Outbound?\n-----------------------------------\n\nOur AI-first platform equips your team with best-in-class outbound tools and our AI BDR Ava, who automates your entire outbound workflow.\n\nPhone\n\nGet Started\n\n### Products\n\n*   [Artisan Sales Overview](/sales-ai)\n    \n*   [Ava, the AI Sales Agent](/ai-sales-agent)\n    \n*   [B2B Data](/products/b2b-data)\n    \n*   [Sales Playbooks](/products/sales-playbooks)\n    \n*   [Email Warmup](/products/email-warmup)\n    \n*   [Sales Automation](/products/sales-automation)\n    \n\n### Resources\n\n*   [Blog](/blog)\n    \n*   [Demos](/watch-demo)\n    \n*   [Support](https://support.artisan.co/)\n    \n*   [Case Studies](/casestudies)\n    \n*   ChangelogSoon\n    \n\n### Solutions\n\n*   [Enterprise](/solutions/enterprise)\n    \n*   [Midmarket](/solutions/midmarket)\n    \n*   [Startups](/solutions/startups)\n    \n*   Lead Gen AgenciesSoon\n    \n\n### Company\n\n*   [About Us](/about)\n    \n*   [Contact Us](/contact-us)\n    \n*   [Careers](/careers)\n    \n*   Artisan LabsSoon\n    \n\n![artisan-logo](https://www.artisan.co/_next/image?url=%2Fassets%2Flogo.webp&w=384&q=75)\n\n© 2024 Artisan AI Inc.

It is research-backed action plan highlighting your goals and how to achieve them.\n\n  \n\nIn the world of B2B and SaaS especially, product launches are an uphill battle. Due to factors like inflation and market instability, companies are becoming increasingly economical with their budgets in 2024. Getting a business to invest in your product or service takes a lot of convincing. You’ll need to enter the game ready to illustrate how you’re uniquely qualified to help companies thrive.\n\n  \n\nIf you’re struggling with where to start, consider this your 2024 guide to building a top-notch B2B go-to-market strategy.\n\n  \n\nWhat Is A B2B Go-To-Market Strategy?\n------------------------------------\n\nYour B2B go-to-market (GTM) strategy is your roadmap. It’s a comprehensive plan that outlines how your company will introduce and deliver its products or services to the market, attract customers, and achieve a competitive advantage. According to Gartner, a GTM strategy [answers two questions](https://www.gartner.com/en/digital-markets/insights/what-is-go-to-market-strategy)\n – who and how? That is, who is the ideal target for your product or service and how can you best engage them?\n\n  \n\nHow Are SaaS B2B Go-To-Market Strategies Unique?\n------------------------------------------------\n\nWhen it comes to SaaS, there are some unique factors to consider when hashing out your B2B go-to-market strategy, including:\n\n  \n\n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Subscription Models:** As SaaS products typically focus on subscription-based pricing models, you can spend more time and money acquiring customers as they have higher lifetime values.\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Online Distribution and Sales:** Your website is crucial when it comes to SaaS sales. Plan to optimize your sales funnel and leverage appropriate digital marketing channels.\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Scalability:** As SaaS products can be delivered globally with minimal additional cost, make sure your B2B GTM strategy addresses how you plan to scale.\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Customer Support:** This is absolutely critical for SaaS success, so make sure your team has a clearcut plan to provide excellent customer service such as live chat, knowledge bases, [AI customer support](/ai-sales-agent)\n    , and ticketing systems.\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Data Security and SOC2 Compliance:** Building trust is essential when dealing with sensitive customer data. Make sure you not only have a plan for data privacy and security but that you communicate that plan clearly to potential customers. This includes Service Organization Control Type 2 (SOC2) compliance, which is usually required for enterprise customers.\n    \n      \n    \n\n  \nAdditionally, with B2B go-to-market strategies, you’re targeting other businesses. Sales reps and CEOs are more than familiar with typical marketing strategies, and therefore more likely to be skeptical. A clear understanding of your target customers, their pain points, and the solutions your service provides is paramount.\n\n  \n\nB2B Go-To-Market Strategy: 5 Key Steps\n--------------------------------------\n\n### 1\\. Brand Design & Positioning\n\nA B2B go-to-market strategy starts with defining your brand. Branding and positioning help you set yourself apart from competitors and refine your messaging to best communicate with potential customers.\n\n  \n\n#### Understand Your Target Audience\n\nWhen you’re determining who your product is for, you need to look at two factors: the buying center _and_ the buying personas.\n\n  \n\nEstimates range, but expect between [7 and 20 individuals on average](https://www.colonyspark.com/blog/questions-for-b2b-buying-committee/)\n to be involved in the B2B sales process. This makes up your buying center. These individuals play various roles and have different responsibilities, perspectives, and interests. Key roles within a buying center include:\n\n  \n\n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Initiator:** The person or group that recognizes a need for a product or service within the organization and initiates the buying process.\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Influencer:** Individuals or groups that can influence the purchasing decision by providing information, opinions, or recommendations.\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Decider:** The person or group with the authority to make the final decision on whether to proceed with the purchase.\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Buyer:** The individual or group responsible for negotiating and finalizing the terms of the purchase.\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **User:** Individuals or departments that will use the product or service once it’s purchased.\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Gatekeeper:** An individual or group that controls the flow of information to the buying center.\n    \n      \n    \n\n  \nOnce you’ve identified your buying center, focus on the individual roles within that center. Are your initiators sales representatives? IT professionals? Part of the customer service team? What about your influencers? Your users? These titles help you create detailed buyer personas.\n\n  \n\nDetailed buyer personas are generalized representations of ideal customers based on market research. These personas help your company understand and empathize with the different segments of your target audience, which brings us to our next step.\n\n  \n\n#### Create Value Matrixes\n\nA value matrix, often used in business and marketing, is a visual representation that helps businesses assess and compare the value of different options or choices based on specific criteria. This matrix is useful for evaluating products, services, or features in relation to the needs and priorities of customers or stakeholders.\n\n  \n\nFor example, a value matrix might identify a user persona, their pain points, the product value proposition, and the appropriate messaging to attract this specific customer.\n\n  \n\nSay your buyer persona is a sales rep struggling to manage a high amount of calls toward the end of year. One of your product’s key features is that it automates booking meetings. Messages that might appeal to this buyer include “We’ll manage your calendar so you don’t have to!” and “Focus on meeting prep. We’ll handle the booking.”\n\n  \n\n#### Define Your Brand Messaging\n\nEstablishing clear brand messaging prior to launch helps you enter the market prepared to articulate the value of your product or service. Determine the following:\n\n  \n\n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Your mission statement** is a concise declaration of your company’s purpose that outlines the reason it exists. It explains your company’s core values, goals, and the primary stakeholders. It answers the question, “Why was this company founded?”\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Your value proposition** communicates the unique value and benefits that your product or service provides. It answers the question, “Why should I choose this product or service over others?”\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Your brand proposition** refers to the unique identity and positioning of a brand in the marketplace. It’s a broader concept than your value proposition that goes beyond a specific product or service. It answers the question, “Why should I trust _this specific company_?”\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Your Unique Selling Proposition (USP)** is a distinctive aspect of a product or service that sets it apart from competitors. It highlights unique features that address a key customer need or pain point. Think of this as your company’s niche. It answers the question, “What makes this business different from similar brands?”\n    \n      \n    \n\n#### Determine Your Pricing Model\n\nWith the SaaS/B2B sales cycle, your pricing model will typically fall into the following categories:\n\n  \n\n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Freemium:** A free plan with limited features with the goal of customers eventually upgrading to a paid plan.\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Flat Rate:** Your product or service is accessible to all users at a monthly fixed rate with no extra fees for certain features.\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **User-based:** The cost of a product or service is determined by the number of users.\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Pricing per feature:** Subscription costs are determined by the number of features a company needs.\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Tiered Pricing:** Multiple packages offering a mix of different features at varying prices.\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Pay-As-You-Go:** Users get charged based on how often they use a product.\n    \n      \n    \n\n  \nThe right pricing model for your company is highly contingent on your product or service, revenue goals, and target market. We recommend A/B testing during your first few months operating to determine which model attracts the most long-term customers.\n\n  \n\n#### Conduct Competitive Analysis\n\nComprehensive competitive analysis is crucial for developing a robust B2B go-to-market strategy. Competitive analysis helps you understand the current landscape, identify strengths and weaknesses of competitors, and determine how your service can differentiate itself.\n\n  \n\nKey components of competitive analysis include:\n\n  \n\n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Identify your competitors:** List direct and indirect competitors in your industry considering traditional and new market entrants as well as global, national, and local competitors.\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Evaluate product/service offerings**: Understand the products or services offered by each of these competitors and analyze their features, functionalities, pricing models, and unique selling points.\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Review market share and positioning:** Analyze how competitors position themselves in the market and identify any key differentiators and value propositions. This helps you see which gaps in the market need to be filled.\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Study customer segmentation:** Analyze the target customer segments of each competitor to look for potential overlap as well as the needs and preferences of major customer demographics in your industry. Again, look for gaps here. This helps you find your niche.\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Research marketing and promotion:** Check out how competitors market and promote their products and analyze the impact of these tactics. Identify key messaging and look for any unanswered questions that your content can answer.\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Conduct SWOT analysis:** A SWOT (Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, Threats) analysis for each competitor helps you identify internal and external factors affecting their competitiveness.\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Read customer reviews and feedback:** Customer reviews and feedback help you understand customer satisfaction and pain points and identify areas where you have a competitive advantage.\n    \n      \n    \n\n### 2\\. Awareness\n\nOnce you have a thorough understanding of your brand, you’ll be ready to plan your awareness campaign. Awareness focuses on top-of-the-funnel marketing. Here, you will combine paid and organic channels to build initial awareness with potential users building up to your launch.\n\n  \n\n#### Content Marketing\n\nWhen it comes to B2B go-to-market strategies, content marketing is your bread and butter. You can expect a lot of inbound leads initially, so excellent content to snag curious customers is key.\n\n  \n\nHowever, this is easier said than done. These days, people are inundated with content on a daily basis. Type any question into Google and the top-ranking results are bound to be company blogs. A good B2B go-to-market strategy will help your company snag one of these coveted spots, but simply getting leads to click is but a fraction of the battle. You need content that builds trust in your brand.\n\n  \n\nThorough keyword research gives you a good sense of where to start in terms of trending topics, but SEO-optimized blogs in and of themselves won’t do much if the writing isn’t quality. Top-of-funnel content avoids the hardsell. Instead, you’re creating genuinely informative, educational material to establish yourself as an industry authority. Focus on blog posts, ebooks, white papers, and more that strive to address common customer questions and pain points.\n\n  \n\nWe also recommend creating video content. Videos catch customers’ attention fast and are therefore a way to quickly boost brand authority. Product tutorials or brief, educational videos on YouTube can help, as can an active presence on apps like TikTok. Remember, the goal is to provide genuinely helpful information to your target demographic. Try a simple video tutorial on creating good prompts for language learning models, for example.\n\n  \n\nWhen hashing out a content marketing plan, remember what you learned during competitive analysis – look for gaps in existing content. If there’s not a single decent blog post answering the question, “What is the difference between a [digital worker](/blogs/beyond-bots-your-2024-guide-to-digital-workers)\n and a chatbot?” then congratulations! You found the focal point of your next company blog!\n\n  \n\n#### Social Media\n\nSocial media is where you’ll share all your content, but your online presence should be more than just links to your own website. Focus on becoming a brand leader in online spaces.\n\n  \n\nLinkedIn marketing is a great option for a B2B go-to-market Strategy. Long-form LinkedIn posts broadly discussing industry trends help you connect with like-minded individuals and potential customers and begin to establish yourself as an industry authority.\n\n  \n\nHowever, there are other, less conventional outlets that are gaining steam in the B2B space. Start popping on Quora Answers to join in on conversations related to your field. Develop an active presence on Reddit subs like r/sales and r/entrepreneur to talk up your brand, show off your industry knowledge, and create some hype for your upcoming launch.\n\n  \n\nInfluencer marketing is a powerful component of social media strategy. If it’s within your budget, we highly recommend partnering with relevant influencers in your field. Influencers have built-in trust with existing consumers, which grants you immediate access to a massive network.\n\n  \n\n#### Paid Content\n\nAny Google user knows that the first few hits you see when you search a topic are sponsored content. To stand out, you’ll need to allocate some of your budget into paid ad campaigns, content, articles, sponsorships, and more. Consider some of the following:\n\n  \n\n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Social Media Advertising:** Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter ads based on your target demographics’ interests, and behavior.\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Search Engine Advertising:** Google or Bing ads that display in the search result based on keywords relevant to your brand.\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Video Advertising:** Ads that run before, during, or in-between videos on platforms like YouTube and TikTok.\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Sponsored Content:** Pay for articles on popular online publications related to your industry.\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Podcast Advertising:** Sponsor specific episodes or segments of popular podcasts or pay podcast hosts to read and endorse your brand during the show.\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Mobile Advertising:** In-app display ads within mobile applications relevant to your target audience or short video ads optimized for mobile viewing.\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Sponsorships:** Sponsor industry events, conferences, or local community events.\n    \n      \n    \n\n### 3\\. Activation\n\nOnce you have a solid number of potential customers intrigued, it’s time to activate your market. Instead of casting a wide net, activation allocates resources toward those customers most likely to convert and have a high lifetime value.\n\n  \n\n#### Identify Customer Online Behavior\n\n##### Gather Behavioral Data\n\nBehavioral data helps you predict customer behavior throughout the buying journey. Brands employ various strategies to collect behavioral data, leveraging digital technologies to gain insights into consumer preferences and habits.\n\n  \n\nOnline platforms, such as websites and mobile applications, utilize cookies and tracking pixels to monitor users’ browsing behavior, tracking pages visited, time spent, interactions, and so on. Social media platforms analyze user engagement, likes, shares, and comments. Additionally, you can tap into third-party data sources and employ data analytics tools to interpret the collected information.\n\n  \n\n##### Determine the Most Effective Channels\n\nYour B2B go-to-market strategy should have a plan to identify and target the most effective channels for customer outreach. By the time you reach the activation phase, you’ll already have done some of the legwork. Market research and buyer personas identify where your target audience spends time online and how they prefer to consume information.\n\n  \n\nBehavioral data helps you refine your approach even more. Data analytics help you track and evaluate the performance of different channels. Continuous testing and optimization ensures you invest resources in the channels that resonate most effectively with your audience.\n\n  \n\n#### Retarget Potential Customers with Ads\n\nRetargeted ads focus on customers who have already visited your website and shown interest in your product or service. These highly personalized ads target consumers where they already hang out online.\n\n  \n\nCompanies often use Google ads and social media ads on relevant websites like LinkedIn, Meta, Reddit, and X. Retargeted ads focus on a more personalized experience applicable to a specific customer’s interests. Maybe you’re referencing a page they visited or offering a discount on a subscription model they viewed. Retargeted ads remind potential customers that your product or service is ready and waiting for their purchase, but the appeal goes beyond keeping your company on the forefront of consumers’ minds.\n\n  \n\nRetargeted ads show potential customers you’re in tune with what they want. According to [Salesforce Research](https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbesbusinesscouncil/2022/03/11/what-does-todays-consumer-want-personalized-seamless-omnichannel-experiences/?sh=5589e67b1e1e)\n, 66% of customers expect companies to understand their individual needs and 52% expect personalized offers.\n\n  \n\n#### Create Email Lists\n\nYou can snag customer emails in a variety of fashions from opt-in subscriptions to webinars and events to content downloads. Keep lists of customer emails segmented based on interests and needs to create personalized campaigns tailored to individual customers.\n\n  \n\nEmails worth sending during the activation phase include:\n\n  \n\n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Welcoming New Subscribers**: A nice welcome email improves the customer experience and provides useful information about your product or service.\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Personalized Emails:** If a customer, say, was considering a particular subscription model, shoot them a personalized email advertising the benefits and drawbacks of that model to help them make an informed purchasing decision.\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Exclusive Offers/Discounts:** If a customer lingered over a particular product, offer them an individualized discount to maximize their likelihood of converting.\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Newsletters and Brand Updates:** Keep customers in the know about your industry and brand with informative newsletters that provide relevant, useful information.\n    \n      \n    \n      \n    \n\n### 4\\. Revenue\n\nYour B2B go-to-market strategy should include a long-term plan to maximize average revenue per user (ARPU). Remember, getting customers to sign up is only the beginning; you’ll need to focus on both retaining those customers and getting them to continually upgrade.\n\n  \n\n#### Identify Key Metrics\n\nA few metrics worth tracking include:\n\n  \n\n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Monthly or Annual ARPU:** The average revenue per user on a monthly or annual basis provides an overall view of customer spending over an extended period.\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Customer Lifetime Value (CLV):** CLV estimates the total revenue a business can expect from a customer throughout their entire relationship. It’s a forward-looking metric that helps in long-term planning.\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Churn Rate:** Churn rate measures the percentage of customers who stop using your product or service over a given period. A lower churn rate contributes positively to long-term ARPU.\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Expansion Revenue:** Track revenue generated from existing customers through upsells, cross-sells, or additional services. This represents the ability to grow revenue from your current customer base.\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Retention Rate:** Retention rate indicates the percentage of customers retained over a specific period. A high retention rate positively impacts long-term ARPU by keeping customers engaged.\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Customer Engagement Metrics:** Track customer engagement metrics such as active usage, time spent on your platform, or frequency of interactions. Engaged customers are more likely to contribute to long-term ARPU.\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Average Transaction Value:** Analyze the average value of individual transactions. Understanding how much customers spend in each transaction helps in predicting long-term revenue potential.\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Customer Satisfaction (CSAT) and Net Promoter Score (NPS):** Satisfied customers are more likely to remain loyal. Monitoring customer satisfaction and NPS can provide insights into customer sentiment, impacting long-term ARPU.\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Product Adoption Rates:** Monitor how quickly customers adopt new features or products. Higher adoption rates can lead to increased usage and higher long-term ARPU.\n    \n      \n    \n\n#### Focus On Customer Experience\n\nQuality customer experience is vital for increasing ARPU. Good customer experience starts from the very beginning with a thorough onboarding process. Make sure customers know how to use your product and how to get help when needed. A talented customer service team, AI support, and a variety of tutorial materials are crucial for good onboarding.\n\n  \n\nOnce a customer is onboarded, have a plan to ensure a good long-term experience. Some useful tips include:\n\n  \n\n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Solicit regular feedback:** Customers want to be heard. Regular feedback not only helps your customers feel valued, but it helps your company identify and correct any weak spots.\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Take complaints seriously:** This is where investing in empathetic, experienced customer service reps is important. Treating customer complaints with sincere concern helps consumers feel respected, encouraging them to stick around in the long run.\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Monitor customer behavior:** Keep an eye on how customers use your product and which features are most popular. As you upgrade your services, you’ll know where to direct the most energy.\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Plan for continual improvement:** Obsolescence happens fast in software development, so you’ll need a long-term plan to keep your service updated regularly to stay in tune with all the latest industry trends and consumer needs.\n    \n      \n    \n\n#### Encourage Upgrades\n\nThe best way to encourage customer upgrades is to provide a stellar experience that leaves customers wanting more. However, there are some tactics you can employ to speed the upgrade process along.\n\n  \n\nFirst, timing is key. The most effective time to ask for an upgrade is when a customer is already in buyer mode, so offer upgrade options at checkout based on that customers’ specific purchases or subscription model. Not every customer will bite, but it’ll plant a seed for potential upgrades later on.\n\n  \n\nSecond, remember that consumers crave a personal experience. Track how your customers use your product or service and create upgrade options tailored to what would be most useful to them.\n\n  \n\nThird, a little taste can entice customers to take the plunge. Try unlocking new features for free temporarily or offering free upgrade trials to long-term customers. Customers who would otherwise be wary to throw money down immediately may be more likely to upgrade if they can test out new features first.\n\n  \n\n### 5\\. Virality\n\nWhen you’re launching a new product or service, word of mouth is crucial. A good B2B go-to-market strategy should plan to incentivize customers to talk up your product.\n\n  \n\n#### Shareable Marketing Campaigns\n\nIf you’re on social media, around late November you probably start seeing friends share their Spotify Wrapped list, detailing the songs and genres they listened to most that year. Spotify Wrapped remains an ingenious marketing campaign as it gives users something fun and personalized that they get excited about posting.\n\n  \n\nSo, what’s your Spotify Wrapped? Brainstorming some shareable marketing campaigns prior to your launch sets you up for success. After your product has made a splash for a few months, you’ll have a plan in place to get customers talking.\n\n  \n\nFor example, maybe you’re rolling out an AI assistant that helps with company tasks ranging from data entry to scheduling meetings to managing customer inquiries. A good end-of-year campaign could be providing companies with metrics like the number of meetings booked, the number of customer complaints resolved, the number of employee hours saved, and so on. This is the kind of personalized content that users genuinely enjoy sharing.\n\n  \n\n#### Encourage Reviews\n\nAccording to Gartner, [86% of software buyers](https://www.gartner.com/en/digital-markets/insights/what-is-go-to-market-strategy)\n consider verified customer reviews a vital part of the buying process. For a B2B go-to-market strategy, you’ll need a plan to encourage customer reviews.\n\n  \n\nAs with asking for upgrades, timing matters. Ask for reviews at the right time, preferably when the customer has recently experienced a positive interaction or achieved a successful outcome with your product or service.\n\n  \n\nOther ways to encourage reviews include:\n\n  \n\n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Email Campaigns:** Implement email campaigns to request reviews including direct links to your review platforms.\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Thank-You Pages:** After a purchase or a positive interaction, redirect customers to a thank-you page that includes a request for a review.\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Social Media:** Share success stories, and directly ask your followers to share their experiences on review platforms.\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Personalize Requests:** Personalize your review requests by mentioning specific interactions or purchases. This shows customers that their individual experiences matter.\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    **Respond to Existing Reviews:** Engage with existing reviews by responding to them, whether they are positive or negative. This demonstrates that you value customer feedback and may encourage others to share their experiences.\n    \n      \n    \n\n#### Referrals and Affiliate Programs\n\nReferral and affiliate programs are great ways to encourage customers to spread the word about your product. Consider employing both in your B2B GTM strategy.\n\n  \n\n##### Referral Programs\n\nReferral programs encourage existing customers to recommend a product or service to their friends, family, or colleagues. A business establishes a referral program with clear incentives. Existing customers receive a referral link or code and advocates share this link or code with others. When a new customer makes a purchase using the referral link or code, the advocate receives the predetermined incentive.\n\n  \n\nReferrals help build personal relationships and trust, tap into customers’ existing networks, and are cost-effective compared to other acquisition methods.\n\n  \n\n##### Affiliate Programs\n\nAffiliate programs involve partnering with external individuals or entities (affiliates) who promote a product or service in exchange for a commission for each sale or lead generated. Affiliates sign up and receive unique affiliate links or tracking codes and then promote the product or service through various channels. When a sale or lead is generated through an affiliate’s efforts, they earn a commission.\n\n  \n\nAffiliate programs expand reach by leveraging a network of affiliates, attracting professional marketers and influencers, and providing a scalable model for driving sales.\n\n  \n\nThe Bottom Line\n---------------\n\nCreating a B2B go-to-market strategy can be daunting, but it’s ultimately worth the effort. An already tough playing field is going to become more and more competitive in 2024, especially with so many new players entering the SaaS game. Before launching, understanding your target audience and learning the most effective means to communicate with them will set you apart in an oversaturated market.\n\n  \n\nShare Article\n\n![copy-link](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/copy-link.svg)[![copy-link](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/mail.svg)](mailto:?body=https://www.artisan.co/blog/your-2024-b2b-go-to-market-strategy-a-comprehensive-guide-for-saas-companies)\n\nYou might also like\n-------------------\n\nReady to Supercharge Your Outbound?\n-----------------------------------\n\nOur AI-first platform equips your team with best-in-class outbound tools and our AI BDR Ava, who automates your entire outbound workflow.\n\nPhone\n\nGet Started\n\n### Products\n\n*   [Artisan Sales Overview](/sales-ai)\n    \n*   [Ava, the AI Sales Agent](/ai-sales-agent)\n    \n*   [B2B Data](/products/b2b-data)\n    \n*   [Sales Playbooks](/products/sales-playbooks)\n    \n*   [Email Warmup](/products/email-warmup)\n    \n*   [Sales Automation](/products/sales-automation)\n    \n\n### Resources\n\n*   [Blog](/blog)\n    \n*   [Demos](/watch-demo)\n    \n*   [Support](https://support.artisan.co/)\n    \n*   [Case Studies](/casestudies)\n    \n*   ChangelogSoon\n    \n\n### Solutions\n\n*   [Enterprise](/solutions/enterprise)\n    \n*   [Midmarket](/solutions/midmarket)\n    \n*   [Startups](/solutions/startups)\n    \n*   Lead Gen AgenciesSoon\n    \n\n### Company\n\n*   [About Us](/about)\n    \n*   [Contact Us](/contact-us)\n    \n*   [Careers](/careers)\n    \n*   Artisan LabsSoon\n    \n\n![artisan-logo](https://www.artisan.co/_next/image?url=%2Fassets%2Flogo.webp&w=384&q=75)\n\n© 2024 Artisan AI Inc.

Best practices shift constantly based on factors like the economy, global events, changes in buyer behavior, and, of course, new technology. In 2023, the transformative influence of artificial intelligence (AI) was a massive talking point in the corporate landscape.\n\n  \n\nWhile it started mostly as a theoretical new tool, by the end of the year, brands were already implementing AI in their B2B lead generation strategies.\n\n  \n\n**Going into 2024, AI is poised to redefine B2B strategies and outcomes. Companies need to adapt to survive.**\n\n  \n\nCan you use AI to generate leads? The show answer is yes. **AI promises unparalleled efficiency and precision in identifying and nurturing leads.** From predictive analytics to advanced machine learning algorithms, AI is set to empower B2B marketers with invaluable insights and data-driven strategies that go beyond traditional methods.\n\n  \n\nAs we stand on the cusp of 2024, let’s explore how and why AI technologies promise to redefine B2B lead generation and offer businesses the tools they need to recalibrate and thrive in a new, unpredictable market.\n\n  \n\nWhy is B2B Lead Generation So Important?\n----------------------------------------\n\n![41](https://www.artisan.co/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.ctfassets.net%2Fkyprwggh4muz%2F6F1iNOSDCoCyNcaIGGMIBN%2F081ab59b34bd2d218b4ade9b041aa234%2F41.webp&w=3840&q=75)\n\nFirst, let’s talk about why B2B lead generation matters. Most people understand lead generation on a very basic level. That is, lead generation is the foundation of business growth and allows companies to expand their customer base and increase opportunities for sales. **Lead generation pays off; companies with mature lead generation strategies** [generate 133% more revenue on average](https://www.forbes.com/sites/theyec/2022/08/15/lead-generation-how-to-create-and-execute-a-successful-strategy/?sh=2c9eea536927)\n**.**\n\n  \n\nHowever, many people make the mistake of thinking of lead generation only in terms of its most direct, measurable benefits. While increasing revenue obviously matters — arguably, that’s the end goal for _any_ business — **the less obvious benefits of lead generation are just as important, especially when factoring in your company’s long term goals.**\n\n  \n\nLet’s look at the bigger picture.\n\n  \n\nB2B lead generation holds your company accountable\n\n  \n\nBy creating a dynamic lead generation strategy that you regularly revisit in response to market changes, your company stays up-to-date with the most recent trends. A lead generation strategy forces your company to remain relevant via practices like:\n\n  \n\n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    Relationship building\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    Data collection\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    Marketing expansion\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    ROI monitoring\n    \n      \n    \n\n  \nIn short, **lead generation has both long- and short-term benefits, all of which help your company both increase revenue and build brand awareness and authority over time.**\n\n  \n\nWhat Challenges with B2B Lead Generation Face in 2024?\n------------------------------------------------------\n\n![42](https://www.artisan.co/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.ctfassets.net%2Fkyprwggh4muz%2FMAeHTIa80hc1CYuua2LFQ%2F29fa77b8658c45791c34fb6aeb9225fc%2F42.webp&w=3840&q=75)\n\nNow that we’ve thoroughly established that B2B lead generation is important, let’s talk about what to expect in 2024. **We won’t sugarcoat it – lead generation is going to be a challenge in the coming year.**\n\n  \n\nWhy? A lot of reasons.\n\n  \n\nWith recession predictions still waxing and waning, the 2024 market remains precarious, and companies are responding by [scaling back on spending](https://www.insiderintelligence.com/content/b2b-marketing-firms-spending-less-focused-on-roi-2023-2024)\n. Businesses are still laying off staff, tightening their budgets, and de-investing in technologies that fail to provide the desired outcomes. Spending in the B2B sector is going to be much more conservative in 2024.\n\n  \n\nPlus, while it’s not talked about nearly enough, the fact is **_we’re still adjusting to the aftermath of the 2020 pandemic._** The pandemic led to lasting marking changes that make B2B lead generation best practices unclear.\n\n  \n\nWhat worked for decades prior to 2020 is no longer the most savvy strategy. While sales and lead generation were once largely a face-to-face game, the rise of remote work caused a lasting shift. Gartner predicts that by 2025, [80% of B2B sales will be online](https://www.gartner.com/en/sales/trends/future-of-sales)\n. Right now, **a startling 33% of all buyers want a seller-free experience altogether.**\n\n  \n\nThe rise of remote-first practices in sales is something of a double-edged sword. In many ways, it’s vastly easier to reach out to potential customers from the comfort of your living room, and new technology makes it simple to send hundreds or even thousands of cold emails at once. This allows your company to cast a wide net from the get-go.\n\n  \n\nHowever, every other business out there will be doing the same, resulting in unprecedented competition and increased buyer exhaustion.\n\n  \n\n**In short, the market is both uncertain and oversaturated right now. Companies are spending less while being inundated with more.**\n\n  \n\nIn many ways, conventional wisdom still holds up. The recipe for success is twofold:\n\n  \n\n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    Aim for an account-based sales and marketing strategy that targets clients most likely to convert\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    Provide these prospects with personalized emails and ads addressing their specific pain points.\n    \n      \n    \n\n  \nEasier said than done, right? **This kind of targeted, highly bespoke approach can take hours or even weeks to execute. This is why companies are turning to AI.**\n\n  \n\nIncreasingly sophisticated AI technology can automate complex processes and allow companies to reach out to thousands of potential leads at record speeds.\n\n  \n\nCan You Use AI To Generate Leads?\n---------------------------------\n\nAt risk of sounding like a broken record, **we simply cannot overemphasize the importance of a highly personalized approach in today’s market.** A lot of businesses are failing to tailor their strategy appropriately.\n\n  \n\nAccording to _Harvard Business Review,_ [a recent survey](https://hbr.org/2023/11/how-ai-can-help-sales-teams-craft-more-personalized-pitches)\n found that **only 13% of buyers feel a seller’s message addresses relevant challenges to their organization. That same survey showed that only 25% of buyers feel sellers understand their specific role within an organization.**\n\n  \n\nIf your B2B lead generation approach feels cold and mechanical, bad news: you’re alienating potential prospects.\n\n  \n\nThere’s no one-size-fits-all approach to sales anymore. Companies need to address specific buyer pain points head-on to illustrate _exactly_ why their product or service is the ideal solution for their company’s bottlenecks. AI can automate a large portion of your outbound sales process.\n\n  \n\n**Let’s take a look at a hypothetical outbound sales cycle, assisted from start to finish with AI.**\n\n  \n\n### Target the Right Buyers with a Data-Backed Strategy\n\nWhile casting a wide net is important, a ticker-tape parade approach that targets anyone and everyone is a waste of time and resources. A data-backed strategy that identifies the right leads for your product and service is key. AI makes employing such a strategy easier than ever before.\n\n  \n\n**How can lead generation be automated?** Let’s take a quick look:\n\n  \n\n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    AI analyzes vast amounts of data to identify potential leads based on specific criteria, allowing for more precise targeting\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    AI-powered predictive analytics can then forecast which leads are more likely to convert into customers\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    AI algorithms assign scores to leads based on their behavior, interactions, and other relevant data.\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    By analyzing historical data and patterns, AI helps prioritize leads with the highest potential, enabling sales teams to allocate their resources more efficiently\n    \n      \n    \n\n### Easily Keep Up with Lead Nurturing\n\nOnce you’ve used AI to identify a tiered list of leads, it’s time to begin the nurturing process. **Time-consuming tasks that once required hours and hours of human labor can now be easily performed by AI in just minutes.**\n\n  \n\nAutomated email campaigns, chatbots, and virtual assistants all engage leads in real-time by providing instant responses and tailored interactions.\n\n  \n\nGood AI does not merely perform, however. It improves over time, and responds appropriately to customers. AI-driven behavioral analysis tracks lead interactions, enabling dynamic content recommendations based on individual preferences.\n\n  \n\nThe result is a highly personalized nurturing process where AI adapts strategies to evolving lead behaviors and preferences, ensuring that businesses deliver timely, relevant content and experiences. **By enhancing efficiency, predicting lead behavior, and providing real-time engagement, AI empowers B2B marketers to cultivate stronger relationships and guide leads through the sales funnel with increased precision and effectiveness.**\n\n  \n\n### Personalization is Simple from the Start\n\n![43](https://www.artisan.co/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.ctfassets.net%2Fkyprwggh4muz%2F5o7ldHKVuYbO85cHpPPsF5%2Fbcfe318d4eb1f29ef883bce1ad3be154%2F43.webp&w=3840&q=75)\n\nAgain, we’re going to say it – **personalization is one of the most important aspects of B2B lead generation.** In fact, personalization during lead nurturing can [enhance the potential of conversion by 63%](https://www.salesmate.io/blog/lead-generation-statistics/)\n.\n\n  \n\nPersonalization is also notoriously time-consuming, _especially_ if you’re working with a large pool of leads. You’ll have to research hundreds of individuals, their companies, their roles, and their potential pain points if you want to stand out amongst the crowd.\n\n  \n\nThis kind of legwork is traditionally thought of as something that requires human labor, but new AI technologies are changing that assumption.\n\n  \n\nDigital workers are **_specialized for entire workflows._** They can do the same sort of research a human worker can but faster and more efficiently by:\n\n  \n\n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    Creating highly personalized campaigns on behalf of your sales team\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    Researching individuals and companies on a list of targeted leads\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    Drafting highly bespoke cold emails on behalf of your team\n    \n      \n    \n\n  \n[Artisan AI’s Sales Rep Ava](/ai-sales-agent)\n, for example, gives your company access to over 265 million contacts and ghost writes personalized email sequences. What would take a human employee days Ava can do in minutes, which brings us to our next point.\n\n  \n\n### Fill in Gaps in Talent\n\nWill sales people be replaced by AI? **The short answer is no.**\n\n  \n\nYou’ll still need a talented sales team to grow your company. **AI isn’t competition for your existing employees, but a new, invaluable asset.** It plays a crucial role in augmenting the capabilities of your sales teams, bridging gaps in talent that enable human workers to operate at peak efficiency.\n\n  \n\nAI unlocks your sales team’s ability to create highly advanced campaigns. Not every sales rep, for example, has an in-depth background in data analysis. AI algorithms can process vast amounts of customer data, identifying trends, preferences, and behaviors that may not be immediately apparent to human sellers.\n\n  \n\nOr, maybe your sales reps do not have strong backgrounds in copywriting, content creation, or graphic design. AI can write personalized emails that only need minor edits and create compelling images and infographics for blog posts, email campaigns, and more.\n\n  \n\n**By complementing human skills with advanced analytics and automation, AI empowers sales teams to operate more efficiently, improve decision-making, and ultimately achieve better results in driving revenue growth.**\n\n  \n\n### Let Your Employees Focus on What Matters\n\n![44](https://www.artisan.co/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.ctfassets.net%2Fkyprwggh4muz%2F2tGfwxdhefBSjCYjsZDvau%2F963cfe44db57ee30881012e0df507354%2F44.webp&w=3840&q=75)\n\nClosing sales still requires face-to-face interaction, even via digital means like Zoom or Skype. **The human touch is what ultimately seals a deal, with sales reps responsible for addressing a prospective customer’s concerns and needs in real time to really sell your product.**\n\n  \n\nAI can enhance productivity by automating routine and time-consuming tasks, allowing sales teams to focus on high-value activities.\n\n  \n\nWe’ve already touched on a lot of this above. AI-driven tools can automate lead scoring and chatbots and virtual assistants can handle routine inquiries. [Artisan AI’s sales rep Ava](https://artisan.co/ava-sales-rep/)\n can even handle a lot of administrative tasks like booking meetings into your employees’ calendars. This frees up human workers to engage in more complex and relationship-building aspects of the sales process.\n\n  \n\nOnce a lead is booked, sales reps can spend time preparing their pitch, honing their approach, and thinking of creative ways to address company pain points. This increases the likelihood of landing a new lead, and makes prospective customers feel valued and respected during the sales process.\n\n  \n\nHow Is AI Changing B2B Sales?\n-----------------------------\n\nBig companies have already taken the leap with AI:\n\n  \n\n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    Microsoft began using AI sales tools [this past February](https://hbr.org/2023/03/how-generative-ai-will-change-sales)\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    Google [uses AI to handle customer service interactions](https://www2.deloitte.com/us/en/insights/focus/tech-trends.html?id=us:2ps:3gl:ttrep24:awa:cons:120723:future%20of%20ai:b:c:kwd-354986182007&gclid=Cj0KCQiA1rSsBhDHARIsANB4EJY9YeeAKChzTzQiCjQJqKLhI2Kj9Gw0KoWk0l7Xigf5TIsWLP1ntzQaAvtZEALw_wcB#genie-out-of-bottle)\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    Bloomberg just rolled out their own AI model\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    [According to Deloitte](https://www2.deloitte.com/us/en/insights/focus/tech-trends.html?id=us:2ps:3gl:ttrep24:awa:cons:120723:future%20of%20ai:b:c:kwd-354986182007&gclid=Cj0KCQiA1rSsBhDHARIsANB4EJY9YeeAKChzTzQiCjQJqKLhI2Kj9Gw0KoWk0l7Xigf5TIsWLP1ntzQaAvtZEALw_wcB#genie-out-of-bottle)\n    , more than one-third of enterprises are already designing their own language learning models to assist with multiple company processes\n    \n      \n    \n\n  \nPositive buzz surrounding AI will undoubtedly encourage even more companies to invest. Researchers at Stanford University and Massachusetts Institute of Technology recently studied the [effects an AI-based conversational assistance tool](https://hbr.org/2023/03/how-generative-ai-will-change-sales)\n had on 5,200 customer support agents.

Best practices shift constantly based on factors like the economy, global events, changes in buyer behavior, and, of course, new technology. In 2023, the transformative influence of artificial intelligence (AI) was a massive talking point in the corporate landscape.\n\n  \n\nWhile it started mostly as a theoretical new tool, by the end of the year, brands were already implementing AI in their B2B lead generation strategies.\n\n  \n\n**Going into 2024, AI is poised to redefine B2B strategies and outcomes. Companies need to adapt to survive.**\n\n  \n\nCan you use AI to generate leads? The show answer is yes. **AI promises unparalleled efficiency and precision in identifying and nurturing leads.** From predictive analytics to advanced machine learning algorithms, AI is set to empower B2B marketers with invaluable insights and data-driven strategies that go beyond traditional methods.\n\n  \n\nAs we stand on the cusp of 2024, let’s explore how and why AI technologies promise to redefine B2B lead generation and offer businesses the tools they need to recalibrate and thrive in a new, unpredictable market.\n\n  \n\nWhy is B2B Lead Generation So Important?\n----------------------------------------\n\n![41](https://www.artisan.co/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.ctfassets.net%2Fkyprwggh4muz%2F6F1iNOSDCoCyNcaIGGMIBN%2F081ab59b34bd2d218b4ade9b041aa234%2F41.webp&w=3840&q=75)\n\nFirst, let’s talk about why B2B lead generation matters. Most people understand lead generation on a very basic level. That is, lead generation is the foundation of business growth and allows companies to expand their customer base and increase opportunities for sales. **Lead generation pays off; companies with mature lead generation strategies** [generate 133% more revenue on average](https://www.forbes.com/sites/theyec/2022/08/15/lead-generation-how-to-create-and-execute-a-successful-strategy/?sh=2c9eea536927)\n**.**\n\n  \n\nHowever, many people make the mistake of thinking of lead generation only in terms of its most direct, measurable benefits. While increasing revenue obviously matters — arguably, that’s the end goal for _any_ business — **the less obvious benefits of lead generation are just as important, especially when factoring in your company’s long term goals.**\n\n  \n\nLet’s look at the bigger picture.\n\n  \n\nB2B lead generation holds your company accountable\n\n  \n\nBy creating a dynamic lead generation strategy that you regularly revisit in response to market changes, your company stays up-to-date with the most recent trends. A lead generation strategy forces your company to remain relevant via practices like:\n\n  \n\n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    Relationship building\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    Data collection\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    Marketing expansion\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    ROI monitoring\n    \n      \n    \n\n  \nIn short, **lead generation has both long- and short-term benefits, all of which help your company both increase revenue and build brand awareness and authority over time.**\n\n  \n\nWhat Challenges with B2B Lead Generation Face in 2024?\n------------------------------------------------------\n\n![42](https://www.artisan.co/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.ctfassets.net%2Fkyprwggh4muz%2FMAeHTIa80hc1CYuua2LFQ%2F29fa77b8658c45791c34fb6aeb9225fc%2F42.webp&w=3840&q=75)\n\nNow that we’ve thoroughly established that B2B lead generation is important, let’s talk about what to expect in 2024. **We won’t sugarcoat it – lead generation is going to be a challenge in the coming year.**\n\n  \n\nWhy? A lot of reasons.\n\n  \n\nWith recession predictions still waxing and waning, the 2024 market remains precarious, and companies are responding by [scaling back on spending](https://www.insiderintelligence.com/content/b2b-marketing-firms-spending-less-focused-on-roi-2023-2024)\n. Businesses are still laying off staff, tightening their budgets, and de-investing in technologies that fail to provide the desired outcomes. Spending in the B2B sector is going to be much more conservative in 2024.\n\n  \n\nPlus, while it’s not talked about nearly enough, the fact is **_we’re still adjusting to the aftermath of the 2020 pandemic._** The pandemic led to lasting marking changes that make B2B lead generation best practices unclear.\n\n  \n\nWhat worked for decades prior to 2020 is no longer the most savvy strategy. While sales and lead generation were once largely a face-to-face game, the rise of remote work caused a lasting shift. Gartner predicts that by 2025, [80% of B2B sales will be online](https://www.gartner.com/en/sales/trends/future-of-sales)\n. Right now, **a startling 33% of all buyers want a seller-free experience altogether.**\n\n  \n\nThe rise of remote-first practices in sales is something of a double-edged sword. In many ways, it’s vastly easier to reach out to potential customers from the comfort of your living room, and new technology makes it simple to send hundreds or even thousands of cold emails at once. This allows your company to cast a wide net from the get-go.\n\n  \n\nHowever, every other business out there will be doing the same, resulting in unprecedented competition and increased buyer exhaustion.\n\n  \n\n**In short, the market is both uncertain and oversaturated right now. Companies are spending less while being inundated with more.**\n\n  \n\nIn many ways, conventional wisdom still holds up. The recipe for success is twofold:\n\n  \n\n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    Aim for an account-based sales and marketing strategy that targets clients most likely to convert\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    Provide these prospects with personalized emails and ads addressing their specific pain points.\n    \n      \n    \n\n  \nEasier said than done, right? **This kind of targeted, highly bespoke approach can take hours or even weeks to execute. This is why companies are turning to AI.**\n\n  \n\nIncreasingly sophisticated AI technology can automate complex processes and allow companies to reach out to thousands of potential leads at record speeds.\n\n  \n\nCan You Use AI To Generate Leads?\n---------------------------------\n\nAt risk of sounding like a broken record, **we simply cannot overemphasize the importance of a highly personalized approach in today’s market.** A lot of businesses are failing to tailor their strategy appropriately.\n\n  \n\nAccording to _Harvard Business Review,_ [a recent survey](https://hbr.org/2023/11/how-ai-can-help-sales-teams-craft-more-personalized-pitches)\n found that **only 13% of buyers feel a seller’s message addresses relevant challenges to their organization. That same survey showed that only 25% of buyers feel sellers understand their specific role within an organization.**\n\n  \n\nIf your B2B lead generation approach feels cold and mechanical, bad news: you’re alienating potential prospects.\n\n  \n\nThere’s no one-size-fits-all approach to sales anymore. Companies need to address specific buyer pain points head-on to illustrate _exactly_ why their product or service is the ideal solution for their company’s bottlenecks. AI can automate a large portion of your outbound sales process.\n\n  \n\n**Let’s take a look at a hypothetical outbound sales cycle, assisted from start to finish with AI.**\n\n  \n\n### Target the Right Buyers with a Data-Backed Strategy\n\nWhile casting a wide net is important, a ticker-tape parade approach that targets anyone and everyone is a waste of time and resources. A data-backed strategy that identifies the right leads for your product and service is key. AI makes employing such a strategy easier than ever before.\n\n  \n\n**How can lead generation be automated?** Let’s take a quick look:\n\n  \n\n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    AI analyzes vast amounts of data to identify potential leads based on specific criteria, allowing for more precise targeting\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    AI-powered predictive analytics can then forecast which leads are more likely to convert into customers\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    AI algorithms assign scores to leads based on their behavior, interactions, and other relevant data.\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    By analyzing historical data and patterns, AI helps prioritize leads with the highest potential, enabling sales teams to allocate their resources more efficiently\n    \n      \n    \n\n### Easily Keep Up with Lead Nurturing\n\nOnce you’ve used AI to identify a tiered list of leads, it’s time to begin the nurturing process. **Time-consuming tasks that once required hours and hours of human labor can now be easily performed by AI in just minutes.**\n\n  \n\nAutomated email campaigns, chatbots, and virtual assistants all engage leads in real-time by providing instant responses and tailored interactions.\n\n  \n\nGood AI does not merely perform, however. It improves over time, and responds appropriately to customers. AI-driven behavioral analysis tracks lead interactions, enabling dynamic content recommendations based on individual preferences.\n\n  \n\nThe result is a highly personalized nurturing process where AI adapts strategies to evolving lead behaviors and preferences, ensuring that businesses deliver timely, relevant content and experiences. **By enhancing efficiency, predicting lead behavior, and providing real-time engagement, AI empowers B2B marketers to cultivate stronger relationships and guide leads through the sales funnel with increased precision and effectiveness.**\n\n  \n\n### Personalization is Simple from the Start\n\n![43](https://www.artisan.co/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.ctfassets.net%2Fkyprwggh4muz%2F5o7ldHKVuYbO85cHpPPsF5%2Fbcfe318d4eb1f29ef883bce1ad3be154%2F43.webp&w=3840&q=75)\n\nAgain, we’re going to say it – **personalization is one of the most important aspects of B2B lead generation.** In fact, personalization during lead nurturing can [enhance the potential of conversion by 63%](https://www.salesmate.io/blog/lead-generation-statistics/)\n.\n\n  \n\nPersonalization is also notoriously time-consuming, _especially_ if you’re working with a large pool of leads. You’ll have to research hundreds of individuals, their companies, their roles, and their potential pain points if you want to stand out amongst the crowd.\n\n  \n\nThis kind of legwork is traditionally thought of as something that requires human labor, but new AI technologies are changing that assumption.\n\n  \n\nDigital workers are **_specialized for entire workflows._** They can do the same sort of research a human worker can but faster and more efficiently by:\n\n  \n\n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    Creating highly personalized campaigns on behalf of your sales team\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    Researching individuals and companies on a list of targeted leads\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    Drafting highly bespoke cold emails on behalf of your team\n    \n      \n    \n\n  \n[Artisan AI’s Sales Rep Ava](/ai-sales-agent)\n, for example, gives your company access to over 265 million contacts and ghost writes personalized email sequences. What would take a human employee days Ava can do in minutes, which brings us to our next point.\n\n  \n\n### Fill in Gaps in Talent\n\nWill sales people be replaced by AI? **The short answer is no.**\n\n  \n\nYou’ll still need a talented sales team to grow your company. **AI isn’t competition for your existing employees, but a new, invaluable asset.** It plays a crucial role in augmenting the capabilities of your sales teams, bridging gaps in talent that enable human workers to operate at peak efficiency.\n\n  \n\nAI unlocks your sales team’s ability to create highly advanced campaigns. Not every sales rep, for example, has an in-depth background in data analysis. AI algorithms can process vast amounts of customer data, identifying trends, preferences, and behaviors that may not be immediately apparent to human sellers.\n\n  \n\nOr, maybe your sales reps do not have strong backgrounds in copywriting, content creation, or graphic design. AI can write personalized emails that only need minor edits and create compelling images and infographics for blog posts, email campaigns, and more.\n\n  \n\n**By complementing human skills with advanced analytics and automation, AI empowers sales teams to operate more efficiently, improve decision-making, and ultimately achieve better results in driving revenue growth.**\n\n  \n\n### Let Your Employees Focus on What Matters\n\n![44](https://www.artisan.co/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.ctfassets.net%2Fkyprwggh4muz%2F2tGfwxdhefBSjCYjsZDvau%2F963cfe44db57ee30881012e0df507354%2F44.webp&w=3840&q=75)\n\nClosing sales still requires face-to-face interaction, even via digital means like Zoom or Skype. **The human touch is what ultimately seals a deal, with sales reps responsible for addressing a prospective customer’s concerns and needs in real time to really sell your product.**\n\n  \n\nAI can enhance productivity by automating routine and time-consuming tasks, allowing sales teams to focus on high-value activities.\n\n  \n\nWe’ve already touched on a lot of this above. AI-driven tools can automate lead scoring and chatbots and virtual assistants can handle routine inquiries. [Artisan AI’s sales rep Ava](https://artisan.co/ava-sales-rep/)\n can even handle a lot of administrative tasks like booking meetings into your employees’ calendars. This frees up human workers to engage in more complex and relationship-building aspects of the sales process.\n\n  \n\nOnce a lead is booked, sales reps can spend time preparing their pitch, honing their approach, and thinking of creative ways to address company pain points. This increases the likelihood of landing a new lead, and makes prospective customers feel valued and respected during the sales process.\n\n  \n\nHow Is AI Changing B2B Sales?\n-----------------------------\n\nBig companies have already taken the leap with AI:\n\n  \n\n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    Microsoft began using AI sales tools [this past February](https://hbr.org/2023/03/how-generative-ai-will-change-sales)\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    Google [uses AI to handle customer service interactions](https://www2.deloitte.com/us/en/insights/focus/tech-trends.html?id=us:2ps:3gl:ttrep24:awa:cons:120723:future%20of%20ai:b:c:kwd-354986182007&gclid=Cj0KCQiA1rSsBhDHARIsANB4EJY9YeeAKChzTzQiCjQJqKLhI2Kj9Gw0KoWk0l7Xigf5TIsWLP1ntzQaAvtZEALw_wcB#genie-out-of-bottle)\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    Bloomberg just rolled out their own AI model\n    \n      \n    \n*   ![](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/list-item.svg)\n    \n    [According to Deloitte](https://www2.deloitte.com/us/en/insights/focus/tech-trends.html?id=us:2ps:3gl:ttrep24:awa:cons:120723:future%20of%20ai:b:c:kwd-354986182007&gclid=Cj0KCQiA1rSsBhDHARIsANB4EJY9YeeAKChzTzQiCjQJqKLhI2Kj9Gw0KoWk0l7Xigf5TIsWLP1ntzQaAvtZEALw_wcB#genie-out-of-bottle)\n    , more than one-third of enterprises are already designing their own language learning models to assist with multiple company processes\n    \n      \n    \n\n  \nPositive buzz surrounding AI will undoubtedly encourage even more companies to invest. Researchers at Stanford University and Massachusetts Institute of Technology recently studied the [effects an AI-based conversational assistance tool](https://hbr.org/2023/03/how-generative-ai-will-change-sales)\n had on 5,200 customer support agents.

Companies that want to stay ahead should embrace AI sooner rather than later.\n\n  \n\nAI and B2B Lead Generation: The Bottom Line\n-------------------------------------------\n\n![45](https://www.artisan.co/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.ctfassets.net%2Fkyprwggh4muz%2F54Bq83At9SUKgnImVfqJlq%2F0207777c1ff881b8ea47f9623d0d14a2%2F45.webp&w=3840&q=75)\n\n2024 will be an unusually tough year for the B2B sector, and lead generation will be more challenging due to increased competition.

While AI’s been a burgeoning trend for a while now, 2023’s massive technological leaps transformed AI from a niche interest to an investment necessary to remain competitive. We’re well beyond chatbots. Terms like “digital workers” and “the digital workforce” are now taking off.\n\n  \n\nSmart businesses are already adapting. In a [recent McKinsey survey](https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/quantumblack/our-insights/the-state-of-ai-in-2023-generative-ais-breakout-year))\n, one-third of respondents reported using generative AI regularly for at least one business function. 40% of respondents said they expect to invest more in AI in the coming years. The digital workforce is coming. Savvy businesses would be wise to hop on the bandwagon sooner rather than later.\n\n  \n\nBut what exactly _is_ a digital worker? And what separates a digital worker from your classic chatbot or smart assistant? Consider this your complete 2024 guide to digital workers to help you enter the new market poised to thrive.\n\n  \n\nWhat Is A Digital Worker?\n-------------------------\n\nA digital worker is more advanced than most AI we’re accustomed to. Previously, AI tools were mostly trained on specific functions. They might send emails, manage timesheets, or route customer inquiries. Digital workers, however, handle more complex tasks.\n\n  \n\nDigital workers are trained to automate specific roles from end-to-end. The operative word here is _role._ Rather than performing a single task, digital workers are **_specialized for entire workflows._** They’re trained to perform all functions associated with a given job. Digital workers operate in a highly human fashion, sharing more similarities with the average employee than the average chatbot.\n\n  \n\nWhat Can Digital Workers Do?\n----------------------------\n\nQuite a lot! Digital workers can fill many different roles in a company. They can serve as graphic designers, HR managers, [sales reps](https://artisan.co/ava-sales-rep/)\n, and beyond. As technology advances, you can expect even more jobs to be filled by digital workers.\n\n  \n\nDigital workers are trained to act as colleagues. Just like a human employee, digital workers learn organically. By interacting with your customers and your team, they improve their performance based on feedback and company needs.\n\n  \n\nWhat Are the Benefits of Digital Workers?\n-----------------------------------------\n\nCompanies are already reaping massive benefits from AI and the digital workforce as a whole. A [recent MIT survey](https://www.technologyreview.com/2023/07/25/1076532/generative-ai-is-empowering-the-digital-workforce/)\n of 6,049 workers across five countries showed overwhelming enthusiasm toward AI. 92% of respondents said AI made a positive impact on their work, and over a quarter of respondents called AI “a miracle.”\n\n  \n\nSo, what’s all the hype about? For digital workers specifically, there are a couple of unique benefits.\n\n  \n\n### Democratized Access to Labor\n\nDigital workers are great news for startups and small businesses. Companies short on cash are often at a competitive disadvantage. They’re forced to operate with a skeleton crew, only hiring roles that are 100% vital to day-to-day operations. This leads to gaps in expertise that are hard to fill without certain niche skill sets. This is where digital workers come into play.\n\n  \n\nDigital workers are a cost-effective means to access highly skilled labor. If you’re unable to, say, foot the bill for a full-time sales rep or graphic designer, a digital worker can help. Cheaper access to sought-after skills helps businesses on all levels stay competitive, evening out the playing field considerably.\n\n  \n\n### Boosts in Productivity\n\nDigital workers don’t have brains; they have databases. Their memory is significantly better than human workers, and they can, therefore, massively boost your organization’s productivity.\n\n  \n\nThere have already been multiple studies on how AI tools can impact productivity, most of which have shown an overwhelmingly positive effect. For example, three recent [case studies by the Nielsen Norman Group](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/ai-tools-productivity-gains/)\n analyzed AI’s ability to resolve customer inquiries, write business documents, and code small software projects. AI could handle 13.8% more customer inquiries per hour, write 59% more business documents per hour, and code 126% more projects per week.\n\n  \n\nThese are just tools trained to perform a few specific tasks, however. Digital workers, in contrast, **_perform entire roles_**. It’s fair to expect even higher AI-related productivity boosts in the years to come as the digital workforce grows. Being an early adopter of this technology sets your company up for success.\n\n  \n\n### Gaining a New Colleague\n\nRemember, a digital worker is more than just a bot. They interact with your team, much like a real human employee, and learn new skills over time. While the most popular AI solutions on the market are one-size-fits-all models, new technology is creating more catered, individualized options. Digital workers show great promise in this regard.\n\n  \n\nDigital workers have a history of working with each employee one-on-one. They become more in tune not only with workers’ individual needs and preferences but with the culture of your business. The humanness of digital workers sets them apart from other AI. You’re not just gaining a new tool – you’re gaining a whole new colleague.\n\n  \n\nWhat Are The Risks of Digital Workers?\n--------------------------------------\n\nNo new technology is without risks, and, unfortunately, many companies are ill-prepared to deal with potential bumps in the road. According to the aforementioned McKinsey survey, only 21% of respondents say their companies have established policies regarding the use of AI.\n\n  \n\nRisks are not necessarily a reason to avoid investing, but being underprepared for drawbacks has repercussions. Understanding risks from the get-go helps you mitigate hiccups.\n\n  \n\n### Employee Fear\n\nThere’s a well-documented – and understandable! – fear of obsolescence related to AI and the encroaching digital workforce. After all, if digital workers can perform entire roles at a drastically lower cost, what’s the point of maintaining human employees at all? Rolling out digital workers too fast can cause a drop in employee morale, and may even inspire some valued employees to start sending their resumes elsewhere for fear of inevitable layoffs. This is why it is so important to introduce digital workers the right way.\n\n  \n\nEncourage employees to see digital workers as their co-pilots, not their replacements. Digital workers are not here to _take_ jobs so much as to change them for the better.\n\n  \n\nDigital workers are an opportunity not only for more productivity but for a more enjoyable workload overall. AI can assist with tedious tasks where human error is likely, freeing up your employees’ brains for more mentally stimulating, fulfilling work. Plus, digital workers are often taking on roles that would otherwise go unfilled due to budgetary constraints. Digital employees are not stealing jobs so much as filling in existing gaps in resources.\n\n  \n\n### Inaccuracies\n\nThe number one fear associated with AI is inaccuracies. ChatGPT is [notorious for factual errors](https://www.fastcompany.com/90833017/openai-chatgpt-accuracy-gpt-4)\n, something that has stymied its growth in 2023. Digital workers may have superior memory to human beings; they’re still a man-made technology. Just as our brains are fallible, so is AI.\n\n  \n\nThere are two solutions here to mitigate the risk of inaccuracies.\n\n  \n\nFirst, remember the human touch. A digital worker’s performance should be continually monitored, evaluated, and occasionally corrected. Not only does this ensure accuracy, but it also helps solve another major risk with AI – employee fear. The fact that digital workers still rely on flesh-and-blood employees to function properly should help reduce apprehension about their implementation in the workplace.\n\n  \n\nSecond, onboarding is as important for digital workers as human ones. Make sure your digital worker starts off with a strong informational base. The more AI knows about your company, its values, its operations, and its goals, the better equipped it’ll be to thrive. While you’ll still need to monitor your digital workers’ performance and thoroughly fact-check any reports or copy, a strong onboarding process greatly reduces the risk of error.\n\n  \n\nDigital Workers in 2024: The Bottom Line\n----------------------------------------\n\nAI is rapidly advancing, and digital workers are a particularly promising part of the equation. Over the next few years, we expect digital workers to become more and more human and therefore have a lot more functionality. While there are certain risks associated with any new technology, careful and responsible tech adoption helps mitigate those risks.\n\n  \n\nGoing into 2024, keep a close eye on the digital workforce. With the vast majority of companies now using generative AI to streamline business processes, adaptation is key to thriving in a changing market.\n\n  \n\nShare Article\n\n![copy-link](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/copy-link.svg)[![copy-link](https://www.artisan.co/assets/blogs/mail.svg)](mailto:?body=https://www.artisan.co/blog/beyond-bots-your-2024-guide-to-digital-workers)\n\nYou might also like\n-------------------\n\nReady to Supercharge Your Outbound?\n-----------------------------------\n\nOur AI-first platform equips your team with best-in-class outbound tools and our AI BDR Ava, who automates your entire outbound workflow.\n\nPhone\n\nGet Started\n\n### Products\n\n*   [Artisan Sales Overview](/sales-ai)\n    \n*   [Ava, the AI Sales Agent](/ai-sales-agent)\n    \n*   [B2B Data](/products/b2b-data)\n    \n*   [Sales Playbooks](/products/sales-playbooks)\n    \n*   [Email Warmup](/products/email-warmup)\n    \n*   [Sales Automation](/products/sales-automation)\n    \n\n### Resources\n\n*   [Blog](/blog)\n    \n*   [Demos](/watch-demo)\n    \n*   [Support](https://support.artisan.co/)\n    \n*   [Case Studies](/casestudies)\n    \n*   ChangelogSoon\n    \n\n### Solutions\n\n*   [Enterprise](/solutions/enterprise)\n    \n*   [Midmarket](/solutions/midmarket)\n    \n*   [Startups](/solutions/startups)\n    \n*   Lead Gen AgenciesSoon\n    \n\n### Company\n\n*   [About Us](/about)\n    \n*   [Contact Us](/contact-us)\n    \n*   [Careers](/careers)\n    \n*   Artisan LabsSoon\n    \n\n![artisan-logo](https://www.artisan.co/_next/image?url=%2Fassets%2Flogo.webp&w=384&q=75)\n\n© 2024 Artisan AI Inc.

Their outreach efforts were mostly reactive, waiting for potential clients to contact them. As a small company, bioaccess™ found it challenging to scale their business development efforts without additional resources.\n\n  \n\n**”We are looking to get acquired in 3 to 5 years, and for that to happen, we need to show our potential buyer that we are a money making machine and that we have a systematic way of finding leads.

Ava integrated data from various sources, including a niche provider, to create a comprehensive and up-to-date database of potential clients.\n\n  \n\n**”We're a small company - we only had a few people before using Artisan and were wasting a lot of time doing a small volume of manual lead generation. Now I have Ava doing 24/7 mass outreach for us, which is fantastic.”**\n\n  \n\nWhen asked what Julio would want to change about Artisan, he said “nothing.” He did say that he was very excited about our product roadmap, and that he looks forward to the new features Artisan plans to roll out for sales and the Marketing Artisan. \n\n  \n\nBioaccess didn’t have the resources to hire a full-time BDR to do their outreach.
